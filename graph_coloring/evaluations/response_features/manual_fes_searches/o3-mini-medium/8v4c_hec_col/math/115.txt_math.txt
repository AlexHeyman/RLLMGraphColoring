Notice that vertex 0 is adjacent to every other vertex (vertices 1 through 7). This means that whatever colour we assign to vertex 0 (say Red), none of the other vertices may be Red. Thus vertices 1–7 must be coloured using only the remaining 3 colours: Green, Blue, and Yellow.

However, observe the subgraph induced on vertices 1–7. In particular, consider vertices 2, 3, 6, and 7. The following edges show that these four vertices form a clique (i.e. every pair is adjacent):
  • (2,3)
  • (2,6)
  • (2,7)
  • (3,6)
  • (3,7)
  • (6,7)

A clique of size 4 requires 4 different colours to properly colour it (each vertex must have its own unique colour). But since vertex 0’s colour (Red) is forbidden from vertices 2, 3, 6, and 7 (because they are all adjacent to vertex 0), only 3 colours remain available for them. 

Thus, it is impossible to properly colour the entire graph with only the four given colours.
