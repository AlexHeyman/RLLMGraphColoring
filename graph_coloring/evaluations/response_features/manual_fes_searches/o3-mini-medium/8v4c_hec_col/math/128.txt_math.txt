Notice that the vertices 1, 3, 5, and 7 are pairwise adjacent (the edges (1,3), (1,5), (1,7), (3,5), (3,7), and (5,7) are all present). This means that they form a complete subgraph (a clique) on four vertices, so in any proper vertex-coloring they must all receive different colors.

Since we are given exactly four colors (red, green, blue, yellow), these four vertices will use all the colors exactly once.

Now look at vertex 2. Its given edges are (0,2), (1,2), (2,3), (2,5), and (2,7). Thus vertex 2 is adjacent to vertices 1, 3, 5, and 7. No matter how we assign the colors to the clique {1,3,5,7}, vertex 2â€™s neighbors will end up having all four colors. This leaves no available color for vertex 2.

Thus, it is impossible to color the graph with the four given colors so that no two adjacent vertices receive the same color.

Impossible
