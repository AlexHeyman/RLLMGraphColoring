We begin by listing each vertex’s neighbors (using the fact that the graph is undirected):

• Vertex 0 is adjacent to 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (but not to 2).
• Vertex 1 is adjacent to 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 (but not to 4).
• Vertex 2 is adjacent to 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (but not to 0).
• Vertex 3 is adjacent to 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7.
• Vertex 4 is adjacent to 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 (but not to 1).
• Vertex 5 is adjacent to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7.
• Vertex 6 is adjacent to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (and note 6 and 7 are not adjacent).
• Vertex 7 is adjacent to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (again, 6 and 7 are not adjacent).

A proper coloring requires that adjacent vertices receive different colors. We are allowed only 4 colors: red, green, blue, or yellow.

Notice that most pairs of vertices are adjacent. In fact the only pairs that are not adjacent are (0,2), (1,4), and (6,7). In many cases these pairs might be the only ones that can “share” a color.

Now, one standard way to prove that a graph cannot be colored with k colors is to find a clique (a set of vertices each adjacent to every other vertex in the set) of size greater than k. In our case, we look for a clique of size at least 5 since only 4 colors are available.

Consider the set of vertices {1, 2, 3, 5, 7}:

– 1 and 2: adjacent (edge (1,2) is given).
– 1 and 3: adjacent.
– 1 and 5: adjacent.
– 1 and 7: adjacent.
– 2 and 3: adjacent.
– 2 and 5: adjacent.
– 2 and 7: adjacent.
– 3 and 5: adjacent.
– 3 and 7: adjacent.
– 5 and 7: adjacent.

Each pair in {1, 2, 3, 5, 7} is connected by an edge. Hence this set forms a clique of size 5. Since every vertex in a clique must receive a distinct color in any proper coloring, the existence of a 5-clique forces the graph’s chromatic number to be at least 5.

Because only 4 colors (red, green, blue, yellow) are available, it is impossible to assign colors to all vertices so that no two adjacent vertices receive the same color.
