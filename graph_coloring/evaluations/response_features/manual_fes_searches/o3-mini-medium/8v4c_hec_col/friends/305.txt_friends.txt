We first note that every friendship represents an edge in a graph whose vertices are the 8 people. For example, the list tells us that Alice is friends with Bob, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, and Heather. Similarly, Bob is friends with (besides Alice) Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, and Heather. In this way, we can list the friends of each person (remembering that friendship is mutual):

• Alice: Bob, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather  
• Bob: Alice, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, Heather  
• Carol: Bob, Dave, Ethan, George, Heather  
• Dave: Alice, Bob, Carol, Fran, George, Heather  
• Ethan: Alice, Bob, Carol, Fran, George, Heather  
• Fran: Alice, Bob, Dave, Ethan, George  
• George: Alice, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, Heather  
• Heather: Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, George

A key step in determining if four colors are enough is to look for cliques (a set of people all mutually friends, where every two are connected by an edge). If we find a clique of size k, then at least k different colors are needed. 

Note that the set {Alice, Bob, Dave, Ethan, Heather} forms such a clique:
  – Alice is friends with Bob, Dave, Ethan, and Heather.  
  – Bob is friends with Alice, Dave, Ethan, and Heather.  
  – Dave is friends with Alice, Bob, Ethan, and Heather.  
  – Ethan is friends with Alice, Bob, Dave, and Heather.  
  – Heather is friends with Alice, Bob, Dave, and Ethan.

Since every pair among these five individuals is friends, this clique forces us to use at least 5 different colors. But we only have 4 available colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow).

Thus, it is impossible for the 8 people to attend the party wearing shirts such that no two friends share the same color.

We first note that every friendship represents an edge in a graph whose vertices are the 8 people. For example, the list tells us that #0 is friends with #1, #3, #4, #5, #6, and #7. Similarly, #1 is friends with (besides #0) #2, #3, #4, #5, and #7. In this way, we can list the friends of each person (remembering that friendship is mutual):

• #0: #1, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7  
• #1: #0, #2, #3, #4, #5, #7  
• #2: #1, #3, #4, #6, #7  
• #3: #0, #1, #2, #5, #6, #7  
• #4: #0, #1, #2, #5, #6, #7  
• #5: #0, #1, #3, #4, #6  
• #6: #0, #2, #3, #4, #5, #7  
• #7: #0, #1, #2, #3, #4, #6
