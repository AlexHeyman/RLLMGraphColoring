We begin by interpreting the friendships as edges of a graph whose vertices are the people. A proper shirt assignment (where no one wears the same shirt color as any friend) corresponds to a proper vertex coloring of the graph using 4 colors.

Listing the friends of each person:

• Alice: Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, Heather  
• Bob: Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George  
• Carol: Alice, Bob, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather  
• Dave: Alice, Bob, Ethan, Fran, George  
• Ethan: Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, George, Heather  
• Fran: Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, George, Heather  
• George: Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, Heather  
• Heather: Alice, Carol, Ethan, Fran, George  

Notice that the set {Carol, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather} forms a clique (each person in this set is friends with every other person in the set). In graph coloring, a clique of size k requires at least k different colors. Here, a clique of size 5 would require 5 colors to ensure no two connected vertices share the same color.

Since only 4 colors (red, green, blue, yellow) are available, it is impossible to assign shirts such that no two friends wear the same color.
