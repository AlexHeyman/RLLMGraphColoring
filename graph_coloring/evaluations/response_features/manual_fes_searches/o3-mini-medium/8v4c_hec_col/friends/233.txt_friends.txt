We first note that among the 8 people the following complete subgraph (clique) can be found. In particular, look at the set {Alice, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George}:

• Alice is friends with Dave, Ethan, Fran, and George.
• Dave, Ethan, Fran, and George are all pairwise friends (as given by the friendships among Dave, Ethan, Fran, and George).

This means that {Dave, Ethan, Fran, George} is a K4 (a clique on 4 vertices), and because Alice is friends with each of them, the set {Alice, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George} forms a clique on 5 vertices (K5).

Since a clique on 5 vertices requires 5 different colors (each vertex must have a distinct color from its four friends) but only 4 shirt colors are available, it is impossible to assign the 4 colors in a way that no two friends wear the same color.

We first note that among the 8 people the following complete subgraph (clique) can be found. In particular, look at the set {#0, #3, #4, #5, #6}:

• #0 is friends with #3, #4, #5, and #6.
• #3, #4, #5, and #6 are all pairwise friends (as given by the friendships among #3, #4, #5, and #6).

This means that {#3, #4, #5, #6} is a K4 (a clique on 4 vertices), and because #0 is friends with each of them, the set {#0, #3, #4, #5, #6} forms a clique on 5 vertices (K5).
