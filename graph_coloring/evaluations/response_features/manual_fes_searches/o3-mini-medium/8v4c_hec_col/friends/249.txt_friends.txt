We will show that no matter how one tries to assign the four colors—red, green, blue, and yellow—to the eight people while obeying the “no two friends wear the same color” rule, at least one person is forced to have no color available.

Let us denote the eight people by:
 A = Alice, B = Bob, C = Carol, D = Dave, E = Ethan, F = Fran, G = George, and H = Heather.

The friendship relations relevant to our argument are:
 • A is friends with B, D, E, F, G, H.
 • B is friends with A, C, D, F, G, H.
 • C is friends with B, D, F, G, H.
 • D is friends with A, B, C, G, H.
 • E is friends with A, F, G, H.
 • F is friends with A, B, C, E, G, H.
 • G is friends with A, B, C, D, E, F, H.
 • H is friends with A, B, C, D, E, F, G.

Notice that both George (G) and Heather (H) are very “popular” (each is friends with everyone else) and in particular, G and H are friends with one another so they must have different colors.

Now focus on the “Dave triangle” of relationships. Dave (D) is friends with A, B, C, G, and H. There is an unavoidable issue with A, B, and C:
 • Each of A, B, and C is friends with both G and H.
 • This means that none of A, B, or C may use the color chosen for G or the color chosen for H.
 • Since G and H must have different colors, the two “forbidden” colors for each of A, B, and C come from the set of four colors.
 • Hence, each of A, B, and C must be colored from the remaining two colors.
 • However, A, B, and C have some friendships among themselves (for example, A and B are friends and B and C are friends), forcing at least two distinct colors to appear among them.

Thus the five neighbors of D, namely A, B, C, G, and H, will end up using exactly four different colors—as G and H use two colors and {A, B, C} (being forced into the two colors not equal to those of G and H) will use both. This makes the “forbidden set” for Dave equal to all four colors, leaving no option for Dave’s own shirt color.

Since there is no way to assign the colors so that every person’s shirt color is different from that of every friend, the answer is:

Impossible

We will show that no matter how one tries to assign the four colors—red, green, blue, and yellow—to the eight people while obeying the “no two friends wear the same color” rule, at least one person is forced to have no color available.

Let us denote the eight people by:
 A = #0, B = #1, C = #2, D = #3, E = #4, F = #5, G = #6, and H = #7.

The friendship relations relevant to our argument are:
 • A is friends with B, D, E, F, G, H.
 • B is friends with A, C, D, F, G, H.
 • C is friends with B, D, F, G, H.
 • D is friends with A, B, C, G, H.
 • E is friends with A, F, G, H.
 • F is friends with A, B, C, E, G, H.
 • G is friends with A, B, C, D, E, F, H.
 • H is friends with A, B, C, D, E, F, G.

Notice that both #6 (G) and #7 (H) are very “popular” (each is friends with everyone else) and in particular, G and H are friends with one another so they must have different colors.

Now focus on the “#3 triangle” of relationships. #3 (D) is friends with A, B, C, G, and H. There is an unavoidable issue with A, B, and C:
 • Each of A, B, and C is friends with both G and H.
 • This means that none of A, B, or C may use the color chosen for G or the color chosen for H.
 • Since G and H must have different colors, the two “forbidden” colors for each of A, B, and C come from the set of four colors.
 • Hence, each of A, B, and C must be colored from the remaining two colors.
 • However, A, B, and C have some friendships among themselves (for example, A and B are friends and B and C are friends), forcing at least two distinct colors to appear among them.

Thus the five neighbors of D, namely A, B, C, G, and H, will end up using exactly four different colors—as G and H use two colors and {A, B, C} (being forced into the two colors not equal to those of G and H) will use both. This makes the “forbidden set” for #3 equal to all four colors, leaving no option for #3’s own shirt color.

Since there is no way to assign the colors so that every person’s shirt color is different from that of every friend, the answer is:

Impossible
