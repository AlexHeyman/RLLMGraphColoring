Evaluation: impossible incorrect

The graph contains a clique of five vertices. In particular, vertices 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 are all connected to each other, forming a Kâ‚…. Since a clique of size 5 requires at least 5 colors to ensure that no two adjacent vertices share the same color, it is impossible to properly color this graph using only 4 colors.
