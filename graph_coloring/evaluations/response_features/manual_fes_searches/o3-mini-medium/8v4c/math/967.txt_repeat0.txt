Let’s analyze the situation. We have 8 vertices (0–7) and the edges

 (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7),
 (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,6), (1,7),
 (2,3), (2,6), (2,7),
 (3,4), (3,6), (3,7),
 (4,6), (4,7),
 (5,6), (5,7).

Notice that vertices 6 and 7 are very “popular” – each is connected to every other vertex (in fact, vertex 6 is adjacent to 0,1,2,3,4,5,7 and vertex 7 to 0,1,2,3,4,5,6).

This means regardless of how we assign colors, once we give 6 and 7 two different colors (and they must be different since there is the edge (6,7)), every other vertex (0,1,2,3,4,5) is adjacent to both 6 and 7. So the colors used for 6 and 7 are forbidden for vertices 0,1,2,3,4,5. With four colors available, that leaves only two possible colors for each vertex in {0,1,2,3,4,5}.

Now consider the induced graph on vertices 0,1,2,3,4,5. Its edges (drawn from the list) are:

 0: adjacent to 3, 4, 5
 1: adjacent to 2, 3, 4
 2: adjacent to 1, 3
 3: adjacent to 0, 1, 2, 4
 4: adjacent to 0, 1, 3
 5: adjacent to 0

Examine the subgraph on vertices {1,3,4} – the edges (1,3), (1,4) and (3,4) form a triangle. A triangle (an odd cycle of length 3) cannot be 2‑colored. However, since vertices 0–5 would be forced to use only the two colors not given to 6 and 7, the subgraph on {1,3,4} would have to be 2‑colored. This is impossible.

Thus no valid coloring with the four colors Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow exists.

Impossible
