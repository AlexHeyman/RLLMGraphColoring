Evaluation: impossible incorrect

Consider vertices 0, 2, 3, and 4. Note that the edges (0,3), (0,4), (2,3), (2,4), and (3,4) form a complete graph (clique) on these four vertices. Thus, they must all have different colors.

Now observe vertex 5. Its neighbors include 0, 2, 3, and 4 (among others). This means vertex 5 is adjacent to all four vertices of the clique. In any proper coloring, vertex 5 would then be forced to avoid all four colors used on 0, 2, 3, and 4. With only four colors available, there is no remaining color for vertex 5.

Because vertex 5 is adjacent to a clique that already uses all four colors, there is no way to color the graph with just four colors.
