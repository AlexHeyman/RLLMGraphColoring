We want to assign one of four colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow) to each vertex so that no two vertices connected by an edge share the same color.

Let’s list the edges for clarity:

• (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7)  
• (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7)  
• (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,7)  
• (3,4), (3,5), (3,6)  
• (4,5), (4,6), (4,7)  
• (6,7)

Examine the neighbors:
 – Vertex 5 is adjacent to vertices 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
 – Notice that vertices 1, 2, 3, and 4 form a clique. The edges among them are:  
  (1,2), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4).  
A clique of four vertices forces all four to have different colors (since every pair is adjacent). In any valid 4‐coloring, vertices 1, 2, 3, and 4 must use all four colors.

Now, because vertex 5 is adjacent to each of these four vertices, its neighbors already display all four colors. This leaves vertex 5 with no available color different from all its neighbors.

Since vertex 5 cannot be colored without conflict, there is no solution that colors every vertex using only four colors.

Impossible
