Let’s label the people as follows:

 A = Alice  
 B = Bob  
 C = Carol  
 D = Dave  
 E = Ethan  
 F = Fran  
 G = George  
 H = Heather

The friendships given are:
 • A is friends with B, C, F.  
 • B is friends with A, C, D, E, G, H.  
 • C is friends with A, B, D, E, F, H.  
 • D is friends with B, C, F, G.  
 • E is friends with B, C, F, G, H.  
 • F is friends with A, C, D, E, G, H.  
 • G is friends with B, D, E, F.  
 • H is friends with B, C, E, F.

Notice that among B, C, E, and F:
 – B, C, and F form a triangle (they’re all friends with each other).  
 – Also, E is friends with B, C, and F.  

This means B, C, E, and F are all mutually adjacent—a complete graph K₄. In any proper coloring of a K₄, four different colors are required.

Now, Heather (H) is friends with each of B, C, E, and F. That means H is adjacent to all four vertices of the K₄. Since the vertices of the K₄ must all have different colors (using up all four available colors), there is no remaining color available for H.

Thus, no assignment exists using only four colors under the given restrictions.

Let’s label the people as follows:

 A = #0  
 B = #1  
 C = #2  
 D = #3  
 E = #4  
 F = #5  
 G = #6  
 H = #7

The friendships given are:
 • A is friends with B, C, F.  
 • B is friends with A, C, D, E, G, H.  
 • C is friends with A, B, D, E, F, H.  
 • D is friends with B, C, F, G.  
 • E is friends with B, C, F, G, H.  
 • F is friends with A, C, D, E, G, H.  
 • G is friends with B, D, E, F.  
 • H is friends with B, C, E, F.

Notice that among B, C, E, and F:
 – B, C, and F form a triangle (they’re all friends with each other).  
 – Also, E is friends with B, C, and F.  

This means B, C, E, and F are all mutually adjacent—a complete graph K₄. In any proper coloring of a K₄, four different colors are required.

Now, #7 (H) is friends with each of B, C, E, and F. That means H is adjacent to all four vertices of the K₄. Since the vertices of the K₄ must all have different colors (using up all four available colors), there is no remaining color available for H.

Thus, no assignment exists using only four colors under the given restrictions.
