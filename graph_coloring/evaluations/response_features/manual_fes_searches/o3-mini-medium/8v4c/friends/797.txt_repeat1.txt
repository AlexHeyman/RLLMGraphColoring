We first model the situation as a graph with vertices representing the eight people and an edge between two people if they are friends. The friendships given are:

• Alice is friends with Bob, Carol, Fran, George, and Heather.
• Bob is friends with Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, and Heather.
• Carol is friends with Ethan, George, and Heather.
• Dave is friends with Ethan.
• Ethan is friends with Heather.
• Fran is friends with George and Heather.

Since friendship is mutual, we record the symmetric edges. In particular, notice the group consisting of Alice, Bob, Fran, George, and Heather. Check that:
 – Alice is friends with Bob, Fran, George, and Heather.
 – Bob is friends with Alice, Fran, George, and Heather.
 – Fran is friends with Alice, Bob, George, and Heather.
 – George is friends with Alice, Bob, Fran, and Heather.
 – Heather is friends with Alice, Bob, Fran, and George.

This means that these five people form a clique (a set of vertices every two of which are adjacent). In any graph coloring, every vertex in a clique must receive a distinct color because each one is connected to every other. Thus, in this clique of 5 people, at least 5 different colors are needed.

Since only 4 shirt colors (red, green, blue, yellow) are available, there is no way to assign shirts so that no two friends wear the same color.
