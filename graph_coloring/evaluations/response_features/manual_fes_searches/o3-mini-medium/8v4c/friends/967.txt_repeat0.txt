We will show that no matter how one tries to assign one of the four colors (red, green, blue, yellow) to each person, at least one person (in fact, one “central” person in the friendship graph) would be forced to have all four colors appear among his/her friends, leaving no available option for a different color for him/her.

To explain briefly, label the people as follows:
  Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather.
The “friendship‐graph” has an edge between two people whenever they are friends. (For example, there is an edge between Alice and Dave, between Bob and Carol, between Dave and Heather, etc.) A careful reading of the provided list shows, for instance, that:
 • Alice is friends with Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, and Heather.
 • Bob is friends with Carol, Dave, Ethan, George, and Heather.
 • Carol is friends with Bob, Dave, George, and Heather.
 • Dave is friends with Alice, Bob, Carol, Ethan, George, and Heather.
 • Ethan is friends with Alice, Bob, Dave, George, and Heather.
 • Fran is friends with Alice, George, and Heather.
 • George is friends with everyone except Carol’s friend (he is friends with all the others), and
 • Heather is friends with everyone except one missing edge.
In other words, some vertices like George and Heather are “high‐degree” (each is friends with 7 others), and one vertex in particular—Dave—is friends with 6 people: Alice, Bob, Carol, Ethan, George, and Heather.

Now observe the following key point. Look at the neighborhood (set of friends) of Dave. Its members are:
 Alice, Bob, Carol, Ethan, George, and Heather.

Examine the constraints imposed on these six:
1. Both George and Heather are friends with almost everybody (and they are friends with each other) so they must be assigned two different colors.
2. Everyone in {Alice, Bob, Carol, Ethan} is friends both with George and with Heather. (For instance, Alice is friends with George and Heather; similarly for Bob, Carol, and Ethan.)
 • This means that none of Alice, Bob, Carol, or Ethan may use the same color as George or Heather.
3. Since there are only four colors in total, once George and Heather take two different colors, the “remaining pool” available for the others is exactly the two colors not used by George and Heather.
4. However, there is an additional friendship: Bob and Carol are friends with each other, so they cannot both use the same color from that pair.
 • In effect, the assignment forces Bob and Carol to use both of the “remaining” two colors – so between them (and then Alice and Ethan, who also must choose from that same two‐color pool) all four colors appear exactly.
5. Therefore, when you look at the six friends of Dave, they end up covering all four colors (the two chosen by George and Heather plus the two forced on Bob and Carol – with Alice and Ethan having no other possibility but to use one or the other). 

Finally, because Dave must wear a color different from each of his six friends, and those six friends end up using every one of the four available colors, Dave has no valid color left.

Since this forced “4‐color coverage” of one vertex’s neighborhood happens regardless of how hard one tries to reassign colors, it is impossible to give all 8 people a shirt color from {Red, Green, Blue, Yellow} so that no one wears the same color as any of his/her friends.

Thus, the answer is:

Impossible

To explain briefly, label the people as follows:
  #0, #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7.
The “friendship‐graph” has an edge between two people whenever they are friends. (For example, there is an edge between #0 and #3, between #1 and #2, between #3 and #7, etc.) A careful reading of the provided list shows, for instance, that:
 • #0 is friends with #3, #4, #5, #6, and #7.
 • #1 is friends with #2, #3, #4, #6, and #7.
 • #2 is friends with #1, #3, #6, and #7.
 • #3 is friends with #0, #1, #2, #4, #6, and #7.
 • #4 is friends with #0, #1, #3, #6, and #7.
 • #5 is friends with #0, #6, and #7.
 • #6 is friends with everyone except #2’s friend (he is friends with all the others), and
 • #7 is friends with everyone except one missing edge.
In other words, some vertices like #6 and #7 are “high‐degree” (each is friends with 7 others), and one vertex in particular—#3—is friends with 6 people: #0, #1, #2, #4, #6, and #7.

Now observe the following key point. Look at the neighborhood (set of friends) of #3. Its members are:
 #0, #1, #2, #4, #6, and #7.

Examine the constraints imposed on these six:
1. Both #6 and #7 are friends with almost everybody (and they are friends with each other) so they must be assigned two different colors.
2. Everyone in {#0, #1, #2, #4} is friends both with #6 and with #7. (For instance, #0 is friends with #6 and #7; similarly for #1, #2, and #4.)
 • This means that none of #0, #1, #2, or #4 may use the same color as #6 or #7.
3. Since there are only four colors in total, once #6 and #7 take two different colors, the “remaining pool” available for the others is exactly the two colors not used by #6 and #7.
4. However, there is an additional friendship: #1 and #2 are friends with each other, so they cannot both use the same color from that pair.
 • In effect, the assignment forces #1 and #2 to use both of the “remaining” two colors – so between them (and then #0 and #4, who also must choose from that same two‐color pool) all four colors appear exactly.
5. Therefore, when you look at the six friends of #3, they end up covering all four colors (the two chosen by #6 and #7 plus the two forced on #1 and #2 – with #0 and #4 having no other possibility but to use one or the other). 

Finally, because #3 must wear a color different from each of his six friends, and those six friends end up using every one of the four available colors, #3 has no valid color left.

Since this forced “4‐color coverage” of one vertex’s neighborhood happens regardless of how hard one tries to reassign colors, it is impossible to give all 8 people a shirt color from {Red, Green, Blue, Yellow} so that no one wears the same color as any of his/her friends.
