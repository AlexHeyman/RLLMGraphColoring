We begin by listing the friendships:

• Alice is friends with Bob, Carol, Dave, and Fran.
• Bob is friends with Carol and Dave.
• Carol is friends with Ethan, Fran, George, and Heather.
• Dave is friends with Ethan, Fran, George, and Heather.
• Ethan is friends with Fran and George.
• Fran is friends with George and Heather.
• George is friends with Heather.

Now, notice that if we look at the people Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, and George, every pair among these 5 is friends. (For example, Carol is friends with Ethan, Fran, George; Dave is also friends with Ethan, Fran, George; Ethan is friends with Fran and George; and Fran is friends with George.) This set of five people forms a complete graph K₅, meaning every vertex is adjacent to every other vertex.

Since a complete graph on n vertices requires n different colors in any proper coloring (no two adjacent vertices share the same color), K₅ requires 5 distinct colors. However, only 4 shirt colors (red, green, blue, yellow) are available.

As a result, there is no way to assign the shirts so that no pair of friends wears the same color.

We begin by listing the friendships:

• #0 is friends with #1, #2, #3, and #5.
• #1 is friends with #2 and #3.

• #3 is friends with #4, #5, #6, and #7.
• #4 is friends with #5 and #6.
• #5 is friends with #6 and #7.
• #6 is friends with #7.

Now, notice that if we look at the people #2, #3, #4, #5, and #6, every pair among these 5 is friends.
