Evaluation: impossible incorrect

We first note that the given friendship relationships imply that among the eight people there is a set of five—namely, Bob, Dave, Fran, George, and Heather—such that every pair of them are friends with one another. (For example, Bob is friends with Dave, Fran, George, and Heather; Dave is friends with Bob, Fran, George, and Heather; and so on.) In other words, these five persons form a clique (a complete subgraph) of size 5.

Since a clique on n vertices requires n different colors in any proper coloring (where adjacent vertices get different colors), and we only have 4 shirt colors available (red, green, blue, yellow), it is not possible to assign colors to these 5 people without forcing at least two friends to share the same color.

Therefore, it is impossible to assign shirt colors to all 8 people so that no two friends wear the same color.
