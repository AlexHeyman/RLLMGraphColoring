We can show that no matter how the shirts’ colors are assigned, a conflict is unavoidable. In fact, there is a group of five people who are all pair‐wise friends, so if they attend the party, then each would need a distinct shirt color—and with only 4 colors available, that is impossible.

Let’s explain one way to see this.

The friendships are as follows:
• Alice is friends with Bob, Carol, Fran, George, and Heather.
• Bob is friends with Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, and Heather (and Alice, by symmetry).
• Carol is friends with Ethan, George, and Heather (and Alice, by symmetry).
• Dave is friends with Ethan (and Bob, by symmetry).
• Ethan is friends with Heather (and Bob, Carol, Dave, by symmetry).
• Fran is friends with George and Heather (and Alice, Bob, by symmetry).
• George is friends with Heather (and Alice, Bob, Carol, Fran, by symmetry).

In particular, notice the following:
• Alice is friends with Bob and Fran.
• Bob is friends with Fran.
• Also, Heather is friends with Alice, Bob, and Fran.

Thus, the four people Alice, Bob, Fran, and Heather are all mutually connected (each pair among these four are friends). In other words, they form a clique of size 4. Now, look at George. We have:
 – Alice is friends with George.
 – Bob is friends with George.
 – Fran is friends with George.
 – Heather is friends with George.
So George is friends with all members of that clique. Hence, the set {Alice, Bob, Fran, Heather, George} forms a clique of 5.

Since every two people in a clique must wear different-colored shirts, any clique of size 5 would require 5 different colors. With only 4 colors available (red, green, blue, yellow), it is impossible to assign a different color to each person in that clique.

Therefore, there is no way to assign the 4 colors to the 8 people so that friends always have different shirt colors.

Let’s explain one way to see this.

The friendships are as follows:
• #0 is friends with #1, #2, #5, #6, and #7.
• #1 is friends with #3, #4, #5, #6, and #7 (and #0, by symmetry).
• #2 is friends with #4, #6, and #7 (and #0, by symmetry).
• #3 is friends with #4 (and #1, by symmetry).
• #4 is friends with #7 (and #1, #2, #3, by symmetry).
• #5 is friends with #6 and #7 (and #0, #1, by symmetry).
• #6 is friends with #7 (and #0, #1, #2, #5, by symmetry).

In particular, notice the following:
• #0 is friends with #1 and #5.
• #1 is friends with #5.
• Also, #7 is friends with #0, #1, and #5.

 – #0 is friends with #6.
 – #1 is friends with #6.
 – #5 is friends with #6.
 – #7 is friends with #6.
So #6 is friends with all members of that clique. Hence, the set {#0, #1, #5, #7, #6} forms a clique of 5.

Since every two people in a clique must wear different-colored shirts, any clique of size 5 would require 5 different colors. With only 4 colors available (red, green, blue, yellow), it is impossible to assign a different color to each person in that clique.

Therefore, there is no way to assign the 4 colors to the 8 people so that friends always have different shirt colors.
