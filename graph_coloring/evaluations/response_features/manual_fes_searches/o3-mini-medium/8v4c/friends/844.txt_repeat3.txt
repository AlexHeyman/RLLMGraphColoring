We start by constructing a friendship graph where each person is a vertex and an edge connects each pair of friends. From the description, we have the following symmetric friendships:

• Alice: Bob, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather  
• Bob: Alice, Carol, Fran, George  
• Carol: Bob, Fran, George, Heather  
• Dave: Ethan, Heather  
• Ethan: Alice, Dave, Fran, George, Heather  
• Fran: Alice, Bob, Carol, Ethan, Heather  
• George: Alice, Bob, Carol, Ethan, Heather  
• Heather: Alice, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George  

Notice, for example, that Alice’s friendship with Ethan means Ethan is also friends with Alice.

Examine the vertices {Alice, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather}. Check the pairings:
– Alice is friends with Ethan, Fran, George, and Heather.  
– Ethan is friends with Fran, George, and Heather.  
– Fran is friends with Ethan, George, and Heather.  
– George is friends with Ethan, Fran, and Heather.  
– Heather is friends with Alice, Ethan, Fran, and George.

All pairs within {Alice, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather} are connected, so this subset forms a clique of size 5 (a K₅).

To assign shirt colors so that no two friends wear the same color, we must color the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. Since a clique of size 5 requires 5 different colors, using only 4 colors is impossible.

We start by constructing a friendship graph where each person is a vertex and an edge connects each pair of friends. From the description, we have the following symmetric friendships:

• #0: #1, #4, #5, #6, #7  
• #1: #0, #2, #5, #6  
• #2: #1, #5, #6, #7  
• #3: #4, #7  
• #4: #0, #3, #5, #6, #7  
• #5: #0, #1, #2, #4, #7  
• #6: #0, #1, #2, #4, #7  
• #7: #0, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6  

Notice, for example, that #0’s friendship with #4 means #4 is also friends with #0.

Examine the vertices {#0, #4, #5, #6, #7}. Check the pairings:
– #0 is friends with #4, #5, #6, and #7.  
– #4 is friends with #5, #6, and #7.  
– #5 is friends with #4, #6, and #7.  
– #6 is friends with #4, #5, and #7.  
– #7 is friends with #0, #4, #5, and #6.

All pairs within {#0, #4, #5, #6, #7} are connected, so this subset forms a clique of size 5 (a K₅).
