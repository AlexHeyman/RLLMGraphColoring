We start by examining the friendships. Notice that Alice, Carol, Dave, Ethan, and Fran are all pairwise friends with one another. For example, Alice is friends with Carol, Dave, Ethan, and Fran; Carol is friends with Alice, Dave, Ethan, and Fran; and similarly for the others. This group of five forms a clique—that is, every two people within this set are friends.

In any graph, a clique of size k requires at least k different colors to give each vertex a unique color (since every vertex “touches” every other vertex in the clique). Here, a clique of size 5 requires five different colors. Since only four colors (red, green, blue, yellow) are available, it is impossible to assign colors such that no two friends share the same color.
