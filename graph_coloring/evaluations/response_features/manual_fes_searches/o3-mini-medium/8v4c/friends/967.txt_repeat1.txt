We start by “translating” the problem into a graph‐coloring problem. To each person we assign a vertex, and wherever two people are friends we draw an edge between their corresponding vertices. We then have 8 vertices (representing Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, and Heather) and the following edges (friendships):

• Alice is friends with Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, and Heather.  
• Bob is friends with Carol, Dave, Ethan, George, and Heather.  
• Carol is friends with Dave, George, and Heather.  
• Dave is friends with Ethan, George, and Heather (in addition to Alice, Bob, and Carol).  
• Ethan is friends with George and Heather (in addition to Alice, Bob, and Dave).  
• Fran is friends with George and Heather (in addition to Alice).  
• Finally, note that George and Heather are friends.

One useful observation is to look for cliques—subsets of vertices where every pair is adjacent—because if a clique has k vertices then you need at least k different colors (shirts) in any proper coloring.

Examine the set {Bob, Carol, George, Heather}:
 • Bob and Carol are friends.  
 • Bob is friends with George and Heather.  
 • Carol is friends with George and Heather.  
 • And George and Heather are friends.
So these four form a complete subgraph (K4).

Now note that Dave is friends with each of Bob, Carol, George, and Heather. This means that if you add Dave to the clique {Bob, Carol, George, Heather} you get {Bob, Carol, Dave, George, Heather}, which is a complete subgraph on 5 vertices (K5). In a clique of 5 vertices every pair is adjacent.

Since every vertex in a clique must receive a different color, a K5 requires 5 distinct colors. However, the party is restricted to only 4 shirt colors (red, green, blue, and yellow).

Because the graph contains a clique of size 5, it is impossible to assign each person one of 4 colors so that no two friends share the same color.

We start by “translating” the problem into a graph‐coloring problem. To each person we assign a vertex, and wherever two people are friends we draw an edge between their corresponding vertices. We then have 8 vertices (representing #0, #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, and #7) and the following edges (friendships):

• #0 is friends with #3, #4, #5, #6, and #7.  
• #1 is friends with #2, #3, #4, #6, and #7.  
• #2 is friends with #3, #6, and #7.  
• #3 is friends with #4, #6, and #7 (in addition to #0, #1, and #2).  
• #4 is friends with #6 and #7 (in addition to #0, #1, and #3).  
• #5 is friends with #6 and #7 (in addition to #0).  
• Finally, note that #6 and #7 are friends.

One useful observation is to look for cliques—subsets of vertices where every pair is adjacent—because if a clique has k vertices then you need at least k different colors (shirts) in any proper coloring.

Examine the set {#1, #2, #6, #7}:
 • #1 and #2 are friends.  
 • #1 is friends with #6 and #7.  
 • #2 is friends with #6 and #7.  
 • And #6 and #7 are friends.
So these four form a complete subgraph (K4).

Now note that #3 is friends with each of #1, #2, #6, and #7. This means that if you add #3 to the clique {#1, #2, #6, #7} you get {#1, #2, #3, #6, #7}, which is a complete subgraph on 5 vertices (K5). In a clique of 5 vertices every pair is adjacent.
