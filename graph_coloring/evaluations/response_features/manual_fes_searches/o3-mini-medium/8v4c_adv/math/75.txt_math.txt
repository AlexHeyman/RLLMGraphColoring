Evaluation: impossible incorrect

We first note that vertices 0, 1, 4, and 6 form a clique. In other words, every pair among these four vertices is connected by an edge:
  (0,1), (0,4), (0,6), (1,4), (1,6), and (4,6).

Since a clique with 4 vertices requires 4 distinct colors, these four must each have a different color.

Now, notice that vertex 7 is adjacent to every one of vertices 0, 1, 4, and 6 (its incident edges include (0,7), (1,7), (4,7), and (6,7)). This means that vertex 7 cannot share a color with any vertex in the clique. In effect, if you assign all four colors to vertices 0, 1, 4, and 6, no color remains to assign to vertex 7.

Thus, it is impossible to color the entire graph with only four colors so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.

Impossible
