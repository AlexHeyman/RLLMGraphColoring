Complement: [(0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 5), (3, 4), (6, 7)]

Evaluation: impossible incorrect

We claim that it is impossible to 4‑color the graph. To see why, notice that the vertices 0, 1, 3, 4, and 7 form a clique. (A clique is a set of vertices where every pair is connected by an edge.) In our graph the edges

  (0,1), (0,3), (0,4), (0,7),
  (1,3), (1,4), (1,7),
  (3,4), (3,7),
  (4,7)

are all present, so these 5 vertices are mutually adjacent. In any proper coloring no two adjacent vertices may share the same color, so each vertex in this clique must receive a different color. This requires at least 5 distinct colors, but we only have 4 (red, green, blue, yellow).
