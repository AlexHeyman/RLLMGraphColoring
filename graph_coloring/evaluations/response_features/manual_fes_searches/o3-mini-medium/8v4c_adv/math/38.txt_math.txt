We start by noting the following edges between vertices (with vertices labeled 0 through 7):

 (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,6), (0,7),
 (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7),
 (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7),
 (3,4), (3,5),
 (4,6), (4,7),
 (5,6), (5,7).

Observe that the set {1, 2, 4, 7} forms a clique. In other words, every pair of vertices from {1, 2, 4, 7} is connected:
 • 1–2, 1–4, 1–7,
 • 2–4, 2–7,
 • 4–7.
In any proper vertex-coloring, all vertices in a clique must receive distinct colors. With four colors available (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow), this clique must use all four colors.

Now note that vertex 6 is adjacent to each member of this clique (edges: (1,6), (2,6), (4,6), and from the list (2,6) confirms 6 is adjacent to 2, etc., and (0,6) and (5,6) show other adjacencies but we focus on the clique). Thus, vertex 6 touches all four colors forced on the clique {1, 2, 4, 7}.

Since there are only four colors available and vertex 6 is adjacent to vertices in every one of those colors, there is no remaining color to assign to vertex 6. This makes it impossible to produce a proper 4‐coloring of the graph.

Impossible
