We start by noticing that a proper vertex‐coloring of an undirected graph using only four colors is possible if the chromatic number of the graph (the minimum number of colors needed) is 4 or less. One common method for showing that 4‐coloring is impossible is to find a clique (a set of vertices every two of which are adjacent) with at least 5 vertices.

Let’s look at the given edges and note the following:

• Vertex 1 is adjacent to 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
• Vertex 2 is adjacent to 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
• Vertex 3 is adjacent to 1, 2, 6, 7.
• Vertex 6 is adjacent to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7.
• Vertex 7 is adjacent to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

Now, check the set of vertices {1, 2, 3, 6, 7}. Verify that every pair of these vertices is indeed connected by an edge:

– (1,2) is in the edge set.
– (1,3) is in the edge set.
– (1,6) is in the edge set.
– (1,7) is in the edge set.
– (2,3) is in the edge set.
– (2,6) is in the edge set.
– (2,7) is in the edge set.
– (3,6) is in the edge set.
– (3,7) is in the edge set.
– (6,7) is in the edge set.

Since every pair is adjacent, these five vertices form a complete graph K₅. In any proper coloring, every vertex in a clique must receive a different color. Because K₅ has 5 vertices, you’d need at least 5 different colors.

Thus, it is not possible to color the graph with only the 4 available colors.
