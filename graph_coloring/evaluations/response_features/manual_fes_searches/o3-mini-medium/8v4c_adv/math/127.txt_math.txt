Evaluation: impossible incorrect

Examine the edges involving vertices 1, 3, 5, 6, and 7:

• 1 is adjacent to 3, 5, 6, and 7.
• 3 is adjacent to 1, 5, 6, and 7.
• 5, 6, and 7 are each adjacent to every other vertex in this set.

Thus, the vertices {1, 3, 5, 6, 7} form a clique (a set of vertices each pair of which is adjacent). In a clique, each vertex must receive a different color. Since there are 5 vertices in this clique, at least 5 colors are required.

Because we only have 4 colors (red, green, blue, and yellow) available, it is impossible to properly color the graph under these rules.
