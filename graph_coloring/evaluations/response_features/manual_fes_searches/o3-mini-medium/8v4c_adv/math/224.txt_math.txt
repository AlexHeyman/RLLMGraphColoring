We will show that no valid coloring of the graph with four colors exists.

Recall that a proper coloring of a graph is one where every vertex is assigned a color (here, one of Red, Green, Blue, or Yellow) so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.

List the vertices (0–7) and the given edges:

 Edges:
  (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,6), (0,7)
  (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7)
  (2,5), (2,6), (2,7)
  (3,5), (3,6), (3,7)
  (4,5), (4,6), (4,7)
  (5,6), (5,7)

Notice in particular that vertices 6 and 7 are “almost universal” with respect to the set {0,1,2,3,4,5}. For example, the neighborhood of vertex 6 is:
 Neighbors of 6: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
Similarly, vertex 7 is adjacent to the same set {0,1,2,3,4,5} (the edge (6,7) is not present, but that is not needed).

Observe next that in the subgraph induced by vertices {0,1,2,3,4,5} there is a triangle. In fact, look at vertices 1, 3, and 5:
 Edges: (1,3), (1,5), and (3,5) are all present.
Thus 1, 3, and 5 must all receive different colors. Also, vertex 0 is adjacent to 1 and 3 (and others), so its color must differ from those of 1 and 3. This forces the vertices in {0,1,3,5} to use at least four different colors.

Now, because vertex 6 is adjacent to all vertices in {0,1,2,3,4,5}, it “sees” the colors assigned to each of these six vertices. In any coloring that obeys the proper coloring rules, the subgraph on {0,1,3,5} forces four distinct colors—
 • 0 must differ from 1 and 3,
 • and 1, 3, 5 (forming a triangle) must have three distinct colors.
Thus, no matter how you assign colors to vertices 0, 1, 3, and 5 (and then to 2 and 4 without adding extra new colors into the set visible to 6), vertex 6 will have as its neighbors all four colors. There will be no available color left for vertex 6.

A similar problem occurs with vertex 7.

Since we cannot extend a coloring on {0,1,...,5} without forcing all four colors to appear in the neighborhood of vertex 6 (or 7), a proper 4‐coloring of the entire graph is impossible.

Impossible
