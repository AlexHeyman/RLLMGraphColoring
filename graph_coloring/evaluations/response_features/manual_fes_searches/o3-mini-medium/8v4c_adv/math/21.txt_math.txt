We start by listing the edges as given:

  (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7)  
  (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7)  
  (2,3), (2,4)  
  (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7)  
  (4,6), (4,7)  
  (5,6), (5,7)

Let’s look at the adjacencies of some key vertices:

• Vertex 0 is adjacent to 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.  
• Vertex 3 is adjacent to 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7.  
• Vertex 4 is adjacent to 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7.  
• Vertex 6 is adjacent to 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, and 7.  
• Vertex 7 is adjacent to 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

Notice that among vertices 0, 3, 4, 6, and 7 every possible pair is connected (for example, 0 is adjacent to 3, 4, 6, and 7; 3 is adjacent to 0, 4, 6, and 7; etc.). This set of 5 vertices forms a complete graph K₅. In a complete graph on 5 vertices, each vertex must receive a unique color. Consequently, any valid coloring requires at least 5 distinct colors.

Since we are only allowed to use four colors (red, green, blue, and yellow), it is impossible to color the graph as specified without two adjacent vertices sharing the same color.
