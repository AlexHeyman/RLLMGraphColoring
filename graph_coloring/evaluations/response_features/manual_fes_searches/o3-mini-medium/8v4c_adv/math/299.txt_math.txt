We will show that no valid four‐coloring exists. Notice that the graph has a “clique” (a set of vertices every two of which are adjacent) on the vertices 2, 3, 5, and 6. (Checking the edges: (2,3), (2,5), (2,6), (3,5), (3,6), and (5,6) all appear.) In any proper coloring a clique of size 4 must receive four different colors.

Now look at vertex 7. Its neighbors include 2, 3, 5, and 6. Since those four must all have different colors, vertex 7 is adjacent to vertices colored, say, Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow. In a four‐coloring no fifth color is available for vertex 7. Thus, no assignment of four colors exists so that every vertex is colored and no adjacent vertices share the same color.
