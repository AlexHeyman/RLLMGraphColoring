We will show that no assignment of the four colors {Red, Green, Blue, Yellow} to the vertices 0–7 exists so that every edge connects vertices of different colors.

One crucial observation is that vertex 7 is adjacent to every other vertex (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6). Thus, whatever color we assign to vertex 7 (say, for example, Yellow), none of the vertices 0–6 may use Yellow. In other words, vertices 0–6 must all be colored using only the three remaining colors.

Now consider the subgraph induced on vertices 0–6. Its edges (taken from the given list) are:
  • 0 is adjacent to 2, 4, 5, and 6.
  • 1 is adjacent to 2, 4, and 6.
  • 2 is adjacent to 0, 1, 3, 5, and 6.
  • 3 is adjacent to 2, 5, and 6.
  • 4 is adjacent to 0, 1, 5, and 6.
  • 5 is adjacent to 0, 2, 3, 4, and 6.
  • 6 is adjacent to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

Because vertex 7 forces the use of only three colors on vertices 0–6, we imagine “removing” Yellow and trying a 3‑coloring (say, with Red, Green, and Blue) of the subgraph on vertices 0–6.

Notice that vertex 6 is adjacent to every other vertex in {0,1,2,3,4,5} so whatever color is used for vertex 6 (say Red) cannot appear on any vertex among 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. This forces the six vertices 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 to be colored with only the two remaining colors (Green and Blue). 

However, look at the edges among vertices 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5:
  • (0,2) is an edge,
  • (0,5) is an edge,
  • (2,5) is an edge,
among others. These three edges form a triangle on vertices 0, 2, and 5. A triangle is a 3‑vertex cycle, and it is well known that a graph is bipartite (i.e. 2‑colorable) if and only if it has no odd cycles. Since there is a triangle here, the induced subgraph on vertices 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 is not bipartite and therefore cannot be colored with just two colors.

Thus, with vertex 6 “forcing” a unique color among vertices 0–6 and the remainder having only two colors available, we reach a contradiction: the triangular subgraph cannot be 2‑colored. 

Since the only possibility for the vertices 0–6 (forced by vertex 7’s universal adjacencies) would be to use only three colors – one exclusively on vertex 6 and the other two on the remaining vertices – and this is impossible, we conclude that there is no valid 4‑coloring for the entire graph.
