We will show that no valid 4‐coloring exists. Notice that vertices 6 and 7 have a very strong connection–each of them is adjacent to every vertex from 0 through 5. In any proper coloring the colors of 6 and 7 must be different (since (6,7) is an edge). This means that every vertex among 0–5 is adjacent to both the color of vertex 6 and the color of vertex 7, so none of vertices 0–5 may use either of those two colors.

Since there are only 4 colors available, the vertices 0–5 then are forced to choose from the remaining 2 colors. However, when you look at the edges among vertices 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 the following edges appear:
  (0,1), (0,2), (0,4),
  (1,3), (1,4), (1,5),
  (2,3), (2,4),
  (3,4), (3,5).

In particular, notice that vertices 0, 1, and 4 form a triangle because (0,1), (1,4), and (0,4) are all edges. A cycle of length 3 is odd, so these vertices cannot be properly colored using only 2 colors. 

Thus, because vertices 0–5 would have only 2 colors available while requiring at least 3 to avoid conflicts (due to the triangle), no assignment of the 4 colors (red, green, blue, yellow) to all 8 vertices can avoid having the same color on two connected vertices.
