Evaluation: impossible incorrect

Because the graph contains a clique on vertices 2, 5, 6, and 7 (each of these four vertices is adjacent to every other in that set) they would require four different colors. However, every vertex numbered 0 and 1 is adjacent to all vertices 2â€“7. This means vertices 0 and 1 cannot use any of the four colors used in the clique. Since only four colors are available, there is no possibility to assign a color to vertex 0 (or vertex 1) without conflicting. 

Thus, it is impossible to color the graph with the four given colors under the stated conditions.
