We start with an 8‐vertex graph where vertex 0 is adjacent to every other vertex (1–7). Thus if we assign 0 a color (say Red), none of vertices 1–7 may use Red. In other words, the remaining 7 vertices must receive colors from the other three choices (Green, Blue, Yellow).

Let’s list the edges among vertices 1–7 (ignoring edges to 0, since 0’s Red already excludes that color):
 • 1 is adjacent to 4, 5, 6, 7.
 • 2 is adjacent to 4, 6, 7.
 • 3 is adjacent to 4, 5, 6, 7.
 • 4 is adjacent to 1, 2, 3, 6, 7.
 • 5 is adjacent to 1, 3, 6, 7.
 • 6 is adjacent to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7.
 • 7 is adjacent to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

Notice that vertices 6 and 7 are what we call “universal” in the subgraph (each is adjacent to every other vertex among 1–7). In any 3‐coloring of the subgraph (using Green, Blue, and Yellow), 6 and 7 must get different colors. This then forces every other vertex in {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} to use the one remaining color because each of 1, 2, and 3 is adjacent to both 6 and 7. (For example, if 6 is Green and 7 is Blue, then vertices 1, 2, and 3 would all have to be Yellow.) 

Now examine vertex 4 (or similarly vertex 5). For vertex 4, its neighbors are 1, 2, 3 (all forced to the same single color, say Yellow) plus vertices 6 and 7 (using Green and Blue). Thus vertex 4 cannot be Yellow, Green, or Blue—leaving no available color.

Since whatever way we try to assign colors to vertices 1–7 (remember, they only have three colors available because of vertex 0’s color), we run into a forced conflict at vertices like 4 or 5, it follows that it is impossible to color the entire graph with four colors such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.
