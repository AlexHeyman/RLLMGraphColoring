Let's first note the neighbor relationships:

• Vertex 0 is adjacent to: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7  
• Vertex 1 is adjacent to: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7  
• Vertex 2 is adjacent to: 1, 3, 6, 7  
• Vertex 3 is adjacent to: 0, 1, 2, 4  
• Vertex 4 is adjacent to: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7  
• Vertex 5 is adjacent to: 0, 4, 6, 7  
• Vertex 6 is adjacent to: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7  
• Vertex 7 is adjacent to: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6  

Observe that vertices 0, 1, 4, 6, and 7 form a complete subgraph (i.e., a clique); every pair among these five vertices is connected by an edge. In any proper vertex coloring, all vertices within a clique must receive distinct colors. Thus a clique of size 5 requires at least 5 different colors.

Since only 4 colors (red, green, blue, yellow) are available, it is impossible to color the graph so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.
