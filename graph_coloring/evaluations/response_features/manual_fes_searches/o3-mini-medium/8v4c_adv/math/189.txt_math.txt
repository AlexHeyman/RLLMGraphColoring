We show that a proper 4–coloring is impossible. One way to see this is to look at the vertex with the largest degree and its neighbors.

Step 1. Notice that vertex 2 is adjacent to all but one vertex (it is connected to 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7). In any proper 4–coloring, vertex 2 must receive one of the four colors. That means its seven neighbors must be colored using only the other three colors.

Step 2. Now check the induced subgraph on the neighbors of vertex 2. In particular, look at vertices 3, 4, 6, and 7. From the given edge list we have the following edges among these vertices:
  • (3,4)
  • (3,6)
  • (3,7)
  • (4,6)
  • (4,7)
  • (6,7)

This means that the four vertices 3, 4, 6, and 7 form a clique (a complete graph on 4 vertices, denoted K4) in the induced subgraph.

Step 3. A K4 requires 4 distinct colors if colored properly (since every vertex is adjacent to every other vertex in the clique). However, since vertex 2 has already taken one color, none of its neighbors – including the clique {3, 4, 6, 7} – may use that color. This would force the clique's vertices to use only the remaining three colors. But three colors are not enough to color a K4.

Conclusion: There is no way to assign the 4 colors (red, green, blue, yellow) to all vertices of the graph so that adjacent vertices receive different colors.
