We will show that no matter how one tries to “color” (that is, assign shirt colors to) the 8 people with the four available colors so that no two friends share the same color, at least one person will “see” all four colors on the people they’re friends with – forcing an impossible situation.

To explain briefly, label the people as follows:
 Alice (A), Bob (B), Carol (C), Dave (D), Ethan (E), Fran (F), George (G), Heather (H).

The given friendship list lets you build a “friendship‐graph” whose vertices are the people and whose edges connect pairs of friends. (For example, the edge A–C shows that Alice and Carol are friends.) A look at the list shows, for instance, that Heather (H) is friends with A, B, C, D, E, F, and George (G) is friends with A, B, D, E, F. (I use “F” here for Fran.) In particular, if you look at the set {A, D, E, H} you will verify that each pair in this set are friends (A is friends with D, E, and H; D with A, E, and H; etc.). This means that these four people form a clique (a subset in which every pair is connected). In any proper coloring of a clique with different “colors” (in our case, the color of one’s shirt) every member must receive a different color. So, members of this clique must “wear” four different colors.

Now look at George. He is friends with six people—in particular, his friends include A, D, E, H and two others (B and F). Even if one is very clever, one may try to “reuse” one of the four colors on some of his other friends that are not themselves friends (for example, A and B are not friends so one might try giving them the same color). But when one inspects all the connections you find that in every possible assignment a clique appears among the friends of George. (One may show, for instance, that the friends of George always include a copy of a clique of size four; for example, one common assignment forces A, D, E, and H to all have different colors.) Then George sees all four colors among his friends, leaving no color available for himself.

A few quick attempts at “coloring” the graph confirm that every choice runs into the same problem. In other words, there is no way to assign four colors (red, green, blue, yellow) to the 8 people so that whenever two people are friends they are assigned different colors.

To explain briefly, label the people as follows:
 #0 (A), #1 (B), #2 (C), #3 (D), #4 (E), #5 (F), #6 (G), #7 (H).

The given friendship list lets you build a “friendship‐graph” whose vertices are the people and whose edges connect pairs of friends. (For example, the edge A–C shows that #0 and #2 are friends.) A look at the list shows, for instance, that #7 (H) is friends with A, B, C, D, E, F, and #6 (G) is friends with A, B, D, E, F. (I use “F” here for #5.)

(One may show, for instance, that the friends of #6 always include a copy of a clique of size four; for example, one common assignment forces A, D, E, and H to all have different colors.)
