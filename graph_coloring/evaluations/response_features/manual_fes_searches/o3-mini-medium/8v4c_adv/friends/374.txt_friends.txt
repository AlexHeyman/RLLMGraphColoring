We can show that no matter how we try, a proper assignment of four distinct colors (red, green, blue, yellow) to the eight people is impossible. Here’s one way to see why.

Step 1. List the friendships (which make the “edges” in the graph):

• Alice is friends with Bob, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, and Heather.
• Bob is friends with Carol, Dave, Fran, George, and Heather (and, of course, with Alice).
• Carol is friends with Dave, Fran, George, and Heather (and with Bob).
• Dave is friends with Ethan, George, and Heather (in addition to Alice, Bob, and Carol).
• Ethan is friends with Fran, George, and Heather (plus Alice and Dave).
• Fran is friends with George and Heather (plus Alice, Bob, and Carol).
• George is friends with everyone except himself.
• Heather is friends with everyone except herself.

Step 2. Notice that George and Heather are “universal” in the sense that each of them is friends with all the other 7 people—and since they are also friends with one another, in any proper coloring they must get two different colors. (For example, suppose George wears red and Heather wears green.)

Step 3. Now consider any other person. Look at Alice for instance. Since Alice is friends with both George (red) and Heather (green), she must choose her shirt from the two remaining colors (blue and yellow). In fact, each of the other six people (Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, and Fran) is friends with both George and Heather and so each must choose from only the two colors that are “left over” after George’s and Heather’s colors are used.

Step 4. Look now at the subgraph induced by these six people (Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran) and their mutual friendships. One can check that among these six there is a triangle. For example, Bob, Carol, and Dave are mutually friends:
  – Bob is friends with Carol,
  – Bob is friends with Dave,
  – Carol is friends with Dave.
A triangle is not bipartite, meaning that it is impossible to assign just two colors to its three vertices without giving two adjacent vertices the same color.

Step 5. Since every one of these six people has only two colors available (the two not used by George and Heather) and they induce a triangle (which requires three distinct colors in a proper coloring), there is no way to assign the colors without a conflict.

Thus, there is no possible way to choose a color for every person so that no two friends wear the same-colored shirt.

We can show that no matter how we try, a proper assignment of four distinct colors (red, green, blue, yellow) to the eight people is impossible. Here’s one way to see why.

Step 1. List the friendships (which make the “edges” in the graph):

• #0 is friends with #1, #3, #4, #5, #6, and #7.
• #1 is friends with #2, #3, #5, #6, and #7 (and, of course, with #0).
• #2 is friends with #3, #5, #6, and #7 (and with #1).
• #3 is friends with #4, #6, and #7 (in addition to #0, #1, and #2).
• #4 is friends with #5, #6, and #7 (plus #0 and #3).
• #5 is friends with #6 and #7 (plus #0, #1, and #2).
• #6 is friends with everyone except himself.
• #7 is friends with everyone except herself.

Step 2. Notice that #6 and #7 are “universal” in the sense that each of them is friends with all the other 7 people—and since they are also friends with one another, in any proper coloring they must get two different colors. (For example, suppose #6 wears red and #7 wears green.)
