Evaluation: impossible incorrect

We will show that these friendship constraints force a 5‐vertex clique (a complete graph on 5 vertices) among some of the people, so that at least 5 different shirt colors would be needed. Since only 4 colors are available, a proper assignment is impossible.

For example, observe the following relationships:
 • Alice is friends with Carol, Fran, George, and Heather.
 • Carol is friends with Alice, Fran, George, and Heather.
 • Fran, George, and Heather are each mutually friends with each other (the list tells us Fran is friends with both George and Heather, and George is friends with Heather).
Thus, the set {Alice, Carol, Fran, George, Heather} forms a clique: every pair among them are friends. In any clique, every vertex must receive a distinct color. Hence, these 5 people would require 5 different colors.

Since we only have 4 shirt colors (red, green, blue, yellow), it is impossible to assign colors so that no two friends wear the same color.
