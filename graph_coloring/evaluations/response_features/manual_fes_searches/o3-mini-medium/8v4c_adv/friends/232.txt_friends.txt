We first note the pairs of friends given and then treat friendship as a symmetric relation. Listing the friendships, we have:

• Alice is friends with Bob, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, and Heather.
• Bob is friends with Alice, Carol, Dave, Ethan, George, and Heather.
• Carol is friends with Alice, Bob, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, and Heather.
• Dave is friends with Alice, Bob, Carol, George, and Heather.
• Ethan is friends with Alice, Bob, Carol, Fran, George, and Heather.
• Fran is friends with Alice, Carol, Ethan, and George.
• George is friends with Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, and Fran.
• Heather is friends with Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, and Ethan.

One key observation is that the set {Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, George} forms a clique—that is, each pair among these five people are friends. To verify, check that every two in the set are connected:
 – Alice is friends with Bob, Dave, and George.
 – Bob is friends with Carol, Dave, and George.
 – Carol is friends with Dave and George.
 – Dave is friends with George.
Since all these edges exist, this clique has size 5.

Because none of these five people can share the same shirt color (each pair are friends), we would need at least 5 different colors. However, only 4 colors (red, green, blue, yellow) are available.

Therefore, it is impossible to assign shirt colors so that no two friends wear the same color.
