We begin by interpreting the friendships as an undirected graph. The vertices are the 8 people, and an edge connects two people if they are friends. The given friendships are:

• Alice is friends with Bob, Carol, Dave, Fran, George, Heather.
• Bob is friends with Carol, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather (in addition to Alice).
• Carol is friends with Dave, Ethan, George, Heather (in addition to Alice and Bob).
• Dave is friends with Ethan, George, Heather (in addition to Alice and Carol).
• Ethan is friends with George, Heather (in addition to Bob, Carol, and Dave).
• Fran is friends with George, Heather (in addition to Alice and Bob).

Let’s list each person’s neighbors:

• Alice: Bob, Carol, Dave, Fran, George, Heather.  
• Bob: Alice, Carol, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather.  
• Carol: Alice, Bob, Dave, Ethan, George, Heather.  
• Dave: Alice, Carol, Ethan, George, Heather.  
• Ethan: Bob, Carol, Dave, George, Heather.  
• Fran: Alice, Bob, George, Heather.  
• George: Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, Heather.  
• Heather: Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George.

Notice that both George and Heather are friends with everyone else. Now look at the set {Alice, Bob, Carol, George, Heather}. Among these, every two are friends:
 – Alice is friends with Bob and Carol.
 – Bob is friends with Alice and Carol.
 – Both Alice, Bob, and Carol are also friends with George and Heather (since everyone is friends with George and Heather).
 – And George and Heather are friends with each other.

Thus, {Alice, Bob, Carol, George, Heather} forms a clique of 5 people. In any proper coloring (where friends must wear different colors), every person in a clique must have a different color. This clique forces the use of at least 5 different colors.

Since only 4 colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow) are available, it is impossible to assign shirts to everyone under the given constraints.

We begin by interpreting the friendships as an undirected graph. The vertices are the 8 people, and an edge connects two people if they are friends. The given friendships are:

• #0 is friends with #1, #2, #3, #5, #6, #7.
• #1 is friends with #2, #4, #5, #6, #7 (in addition to #0).
• #2 is friends with #3, #4, #6, #7 (in addition to #0 and #1).
• #3 is friends with #4, #6, #7 (in addition to #0 and #2).
• #4 is friends with #6, #7 (in addition to #1, #2, and #3).
• #5 is friends with #6, #7 (in addition to #0 and #1).

Let’s list each person’s neighbors:

• #0: #1, #2, #3, #5, #6, #7.  
• #1: #0, #2, #4, #5, #6, #7.  
• #2: #0, #1, #3, #4, #6, #7.  
• #3: #0, #2, #4, #6, #7.  
• #4: #1, #2, #3, #6, #7.  
• #5: #0, #1, #6, #7.  
• #6: #0, #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #7.  
• #7: #0, #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6.

Notice that both #6 and #7 are friends with everyone else. Now look at the set {#0, #1, #2, #6, #7}. Among these, every two are friends:
 – #0 is friends with #1 and #2.
 – #1 is friends with #0 and #2.
 – Both #0, #1, and #2 are also friends with #6 and #7 (since everyone is friends with #6 and #7).
 – And #6 and #7 are friends with each other.

Thus, {#0, #1, #2, #6, #7} forms a clique of 5 people. In any proper coloring (where friends must wear different colors), every person in a clique must have a different color. This clique forces the use of at least 5 different colors.

Since only 4 colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow) are available, it is impossible to assign shirts to everyone under the given constraints.
