We first list the friendships as given (assuming that “friends with” means the relation is symmetric):

• Alice is friends with Bob, Carol, Ethan, George, and Heather.
• Bob is friends with Alice, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, and Heather.
• Carol is friends with Alice, Dave, Ethan, George, and Heather.
• Dave is friends with Bob, Carol, Ethan, Fran, George, and Heather.
• Ethan is friends with Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, George, and Heather.
• Fran is friends with Bob, Dave, George, and Heather.
• George is friends with Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, and Heather.
• Heather is friends with Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, and George.

Notice that the set of people {Bob, Dave, Ethan, George, Heather} all share friendships with one another. Check:
 – Bob is friends with Dave, Ethan, George, and Heather;
 – Dave is friends with Ethan, George, and Heather;
 – Ethan is friends with George and Heather;
 – George is friends with Heather;
Thus, these five form a clique (i.e. they are all mutually connected). In graph theory, a clique of size 5 requires at least 5 different colors to color the vertices so that adjacent vertices have distinct colors.

Since only 4 shirt colors (red, green, blue, yellow) are available, it is impossible to assign colors to all 8 people in a way that no two friends wear the same shirt color.
