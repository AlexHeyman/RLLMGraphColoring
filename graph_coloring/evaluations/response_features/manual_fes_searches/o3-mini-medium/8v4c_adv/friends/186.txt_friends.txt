We will show that no matter how the eight people choose shirts from the four available colors, there is always someone forced to share a shirt color with one of their friends.

Let the eight people be denoted by A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H standing for Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, and Heather respectively. The given friendship relationships can be summarized as follows:

• A (Alice) is friends with: B, E, G, H.
• B (Bob) is friends with: A, C, D, E, F, G, H.
• C (Carol) is friends with: B, D, E, F, G, H.
• D (Dave) is friends with: B, C, G, H.
• E (Ethan) is friends with: A, B, C, G, H.
• F (Fran) is friends with: B, C, G, H.
• G (George) is friends with: A, B, C, D, E, F, H.
• H (Heather) is friends with: A, B, C, D, E, F, G.

Notice that Bob, Carol, George, and Heather are all mutual friends. In addition, Dave is friends with Bob, Carol, George, and Heather. That means that the set {B, C, D, G, H} forms a clique – every pair in that set is friends with each other. (To check, note for example that B is friends with C, D, G, and H; C is friends with D, G, and H; and so on.)

A clique of size k requires that all k vertices be assigned different colors. Since {B, C, D, G, H} is a clique of size 5, a valid shirt assignment would need at least 5 different colors so that none of these friends would share a shirt color. However, only 4 colors (red, green, blue, yellow) are available.

Thus, it is impossible to assign shirt colors to the 8 people so that no pair of friends wear the same color.

We will show that no matter how the eight people choose shirts from the four available colors, there is always someone forced to share a shirt color with one of their friends.

Let the eight people be denoted by A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H standing for #0, #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, and #7 respectively. The given friendship relationships can be summarized as follows:

• A (#0) is friends with: B, E, G, H.
• B (#1) is friends with: A, C, D, E, F, G, H.
• C (#2) is friends with: B, D, E, F, G, H.
• D (#3) is friends with: B, C, G, H.
• E (#4) is friends with: A, B, C, G, H.
• F (#5) is friends with: B, C, G, H.
• G (#6) is friends with: A, B, C, D, E, F, H.
• H (#7) is friends with: A, B, C, D, E, F, G.

Notice that #1, #2, #6, and #7 are all mutual friends. In addition, #3 is friends with #1, #2, #6, and #7. That means that the set {B, C, D, G, H} forms a clique – every pair in that set is friends with each other. (To check, note for example that B is friends with C, D, G, and H; C is friends with D, G, and H; and so on.)
