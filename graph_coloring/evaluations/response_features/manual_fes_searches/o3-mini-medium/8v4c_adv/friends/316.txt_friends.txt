We will show that no assignment of red, green, blue, and yellow to the eight people can “avoid clashes” along every friendship—i.e. guarantee that every pair of friends wears different colors.

Let us denote the people by their first letters:
 A = Alice, B = Bob, C = Carol, D = Dave, E = Ethan, F = Fran, G = George, H = Heather.

The friendship list is as follows:
 • A is friends with C, D, E, F, G, H.
 • B is friends with C, D, E, F, G, H.
 • C is friends with D, E, G, H.
 • D is friends with F, G, H.
 • E is friends with G, H.
 • F is friends with G, H.

Thus, note that A and B are “universal” among the rest (except they are not friends with each other) and that both G and H are very “saturated” in that they are friends with everyone except the pair A–B and each other has the same set of six common friends: {A, B, C, D, E, F}.

Let S = {A, B, C, D, E, F} be the six vertices (people) that are friends with both G and H. Our aim is to “save” at least two colors for the pair G and H. (Because if S uses only three of the four colors then both G and H would be forced into the unique missing color—and that would force them to share a color even though G and H are friends. On the other hand, if S uses all four colors, then each of G and H sees every color among his/her friends, leaving no available color.)

Examine S more closely. Among these six people, the edges are:
 • A is adjacent to C, D, E, F.
 • B is adjacent to C, D, E, F.
 • And in addition, we have extra edges: C–D, C–E, D–F.
(There are no other friendships among these six.) Because A (for example) is adjacent to C and D, and because C and D are themselves friends, the vertices A, C, and D form a triangle. In any proper coloring of a triangle each vertex must get a different color. Hence the vertices in S must use at least three different colors.

Thus there are two cases to consider for the set S:
 Case 1. S uses exactly three distinct colors.
  Then every vertex in G’s (and H’s) neighborhood (namely, S) wears only three colors. In order to avoid a conflict with any friend, any candidate color for G must differ from every color present among its (6) neighbors. With three colors used on S, let’s say the colors present are, for example, Red, Blue, and Green; then the only available color for G would be Yellow. Similarly, H is in the same situation (its neighbors are exactly S) so it would also have to be Yellow. But since G and H are friends, they cannot have the same color. This is a contradiction.
 Case 2. S uses all four colors.
  Then each vertex in S has one of the four colors, and because A and B already are friends with all vertices in S, it turns out that every one of the four colors appears at least once among S. But now consider vertex G again: its neighbors include everyone in S, so G sees all four colors and has no available color to choose from.
  A similar problem arises for H.

Since in every case one (or both) of G and H would have no choice (or would be forced to share a color with a friend), there is no way to assign the four colors to the eight people so that no two friends wear the same color.

We will show that no assignment of red, green, blue, and yellow to the eight people can “avoid clashes” along every friendship—i.e. guarantee that every pair of friends wears different colors.

Let us denote the people by their first letters:
 A = #0, B = #1, C = #2, D = #3, E = #4, F = #5, G = #6, H = #7.

The friendship list is as follows:
 • A is friends with C, D, E, F, G, H.
 • B is friends with C, D, E, F, G, H.
 • C is friends with D, E, G, H.
 • D is friends with F, G, H.
 • E is friends with G, H.
 • F is friends with G, H.
