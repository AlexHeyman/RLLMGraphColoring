Consider just Heather’s friends: Carol, Ethan, Fran, and George. From the list of friendships we have:

• Carol is friends with Heather.
• Ethan is friends with Heather.
• Fran is friends with Heather.
• George is friends with Heather.

Now look at the subgraph on these four people (ignoring Heather for a moment). The friendships among them are as follows:
 • Carol is friends with both Ethan and Fran.
 • Ethan is friends with both Carol and Fran.
 • Fran is friends with both Carol and Ethan.
 • In addition, George is friends with Carol, Ethan, and Fran.

Thus Carol, Ethan, and Fran form a triangle (each pair are friends), which forces three distinct colors among them. Since George is friends with all three of them, George must get the one remaining fourth color. 

That means that among Heather’s friends—the set {Carol, Ethan, Fran, George}—all four colors are used. Since Heather is also friends with two other people (Alice and Dave), her complete set of friends (Alice, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, and George) will also involve these four colors. In any assignment, Heather’s friends will end up wearing all four available colors, leaving no option for Heather to pick a color that isn’t taken by one of her friends.

Therefore, no matter how we try, we cannot assign one of four colors to each of the eight people while keeping each person’s shirt color different from that of every friend.

Consider just #7’s friends: #2, #4, #5, and #6. From the list of friendships we have:

• #2 is friends with #7.
• #4 is friends with #7.
• #5 is friends with #7.
• #6 is friends with #7.

Now look at the subgraph on these four people (ignoring #7 for a moment). The friendships among them are as follows:
 • #2 is friends with both #4 and #5.
 • #4 is friends with both #2 and #5.
 • #5 is friends with both #2 and #4.
 • In addition, #6 is friends with #2, #4, and #5.

Thus #2, #4, and #5 form a triangle (each pair are friends), which forces three distinct colors among them. Since #6 is friends with all three of them, #6 must get the one remaining fourth color. 

That means that among #7’s friends—the set {#2, #4, #5, #6}—all four colors are used. Since #7 is also friends with two other people (#0 and #3), her complete set of friends (#0, #2, #3, #4, #5, and #6) will also involve these four colors. In any assignment, #7’s friends will end up wearing all four available colors, leaving no option for #7 to pick a color that isn’t taken by one of her friends.

Therefore, no matter how we try, we cannot assign one of four colors to each of the eight people while keeping each person’s shirt color different from that of every friend.
