We will show that no assignment of the four colors (red, green, blue, yellow) to the eight people—with the rule that no two friends share the same color—is possible.

Let’s label the people as follows:
 • A = Alice
 • B = Bob
 • C = Carol
 • D = Dave
 • E = Ethan
 • F = Fran
 • G = George
 • H = Heather

The friendship relations are:
 A is friends with B, C, D, G, H.
 B is friends with A, C, D, F, G, H.
 C is friends with A, B, E, F, G, H.
 D is friends with A, B, E, F, G, H.
 E is friends with C, D, F, G, H.
 F is friends with B, C, D, E, G, H.
 G is friends with A, B, C, D, E, F, H.
 H is friends with A, B, C, D, E, F, G.

Observe that every one of A, B, C, D, E, and F is friends with both G (George) and H (Heather). Since G and H are themselves friends, they must receive two different colors. Once colors are chosen for G and H, every one of A, B, C, D, E, and F has those two colors forbidden. In a four‐color palette, that leaves exactly two colors available for each of these six vertices.

However, consider the induced subgraph on {A, B, C, D, E, F}. For instance, A, B, and C form a triangle because:
 • A is friends with B and C,
 • B is friends with C.
A triangle is not 2‐colorable; it needs at least three different colors. Thus it is impossible to assign to A, B, C, D, E, and F only two colors while keeping friends different.

Since every valid assignment must force A–F to choose from only two available colors (because they are all adjacent to both G and H), a proper four‐coloring meeting the rule cannot exist.

We will show that no assignment of the four colors (red, green, blue, yellow) to the eight people—with the rule that no two friends share the same color—is possible.

Let’s label the people as follows:
 • A = #0
 • B = #1
 • C = #2
 • D = #3
 • E = #4
 • F = #5
 • G = #6
 • H = #7

The friendship relations are:
 A is friends with B, C, D, G, H.
 B is friends with A, C, D, F, G, H.
 C is friends with A, B, E, F, G, H.
 D is friends with A, B, E, F, G, H.
 E is friends with C, D, F, G, H.
 F is friends with B, C, D, E, G, H.
 G is friends with A, B, C, D, E, F, H.
 H is friends with A, B, C, D, E, F, G.

Observe that every one of A, B, C, D, E, and F is friends with both G (#6) and H (#7). Since G and H are themselves friends, they must receive two different colors. Once colors are chosen for G and H, every one of A, B, C, D, E, and F has those two colors forbidden.
