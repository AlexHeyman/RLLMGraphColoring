We first note that each person must choose one of 4 colors. Because any two friends must have different colored shirts, a necessary condition for such an assignment is that no set of people who are all friends (a clique) has more than 4 members.

Let’s list the friendships:

• Alice is friends with Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, and Heather.

• Bob is friends with Ethan, Fran, George, and Heather.

• Carol is friends with Ethan, George, and Heather.

• Dave is friends with Ethan, Fran, George, and Heather.

• Ethan is friends with George and Heather (in addition to his friendships with Alice, Bob, and Carol/Dave).

• Fran is friends with George and Heather (as well as her friendships with Alice, Bob, and Dave).

• George is friends with Heather (in addition to his friendships with Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, and Fran).

Notice that Alice is friends with everyone else, so whatever color Alice wears cannot be repeated by any of the other 7.

More importantly, examine the set S = {Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather}. Look at the following four people in S: Bob, Ethan, George, and Heather. We have:
 – Bob is friends with Ethan, George, and Heather.
 – Ethan is friends with George and Heather.
 – George is friends with Heather.
Thus Bob, Ethan, George, and Heather form a clique of 4 – they all are mutually friends among themselves.

But we can actually find a 5–clique in the whole graph. Since Alice is friends with everyone, if we take the clique in S (for example, Bob, Ethan, George, and Heather) and add Alice, then the set {Alice, Bob, Ethan, George, Heather} forms a 5–clique. Every pair in this set is friends. In any clique, all members must have distinct colors. Therefore, to color a clique of size 5 you would need 5 different colors.

Since only 4 colors are available, it is impossible to assign colors to the 8 people without a conflict among friends.

We first note that each person must choose one of 4 colors. Because any two friends must have different colored shirts, a necessary condition for such an assignment is that no set of people who are all friends (a clique) has more than 4 members.

Let’s list the friendships:

• #0 is friends with #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, and #7.

• #1 is friends with #4, #5, #6, and #7.

• #2 is friends with #4, #6, and #7.

• #3 is friends with #4, #5, #6, and #7.

• #4 is friends with #6 and #7 (in addition to his friendships with #0, #1, and #2/#3).

• #5 is friends with #6 and #7 (as well as her friendships with #0, #1, and #3).

• #6 is friends with #7 (in addition to his friendships with #0, #1, #2, #3, #4, and #5).

Notice that #0 is friends with everyone else, so whatever color #0 wears cannot be repeated by any of the other 7.
