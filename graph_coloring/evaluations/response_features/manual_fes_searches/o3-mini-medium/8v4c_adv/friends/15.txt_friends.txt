We start by listing each person’s friends as given:

• Alice: Carol, Ethan, George, Heather  
• Bob: Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather  
• Carol: Alice, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather  
• Dave: Bob, George, Heather  
• Ethan: Alice, Bob, Carol, Fran, George, Heather  
• Fran: Bob, Carol, Ethan, George, Heather  
• George: Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, Heather  
• Heather: Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George  

Now, look at the group {Carol, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather}. Checking every pair in this set we have:

– Carol is friends with Ethan, Fran, George, and Heather.  
– Ethan is friends with Fran, George, and Heather (and, by our list, Carol as well).  
– Fran is friends with George and Heather (and with Carol and Ethan).  
– George is friends with Heather (along with Carol, Ethan, and Fran).  
– Heather is friends with all of the others.  

This means that these five people form a clique (K₅), where every two of them are friends. In any proper coloring of a graph (assigning different colors to adjacent vertices), each vertex in a clique must have a different color. Therefore, a clique of size 5 requires at least 5 colors.

Since only 4 shirt colors (red, green, blue, yellow) are available, it is impossible to assign colors in such a way that no two friends wear the same color.

• #7: #0, #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6  

Now, look at the group {#2, #4, #5, #6, #7}. Checking every pair in this set we have:

– #2 is friends with #4, #5, #6, and #7.  
– #4 is friends with #5, #6, and #7 (and, by our list, #2 as well).  
– #5 is friends with #6 and #7 (and with #2 and #4).
