We will show that no matter how you try to assign the four colors (red, green, blue, yellow) to the eight people while keeping the rule “no one wears the same color as any of their friends,” a proper assignment cannot be made.

One way to see this is to examine a particular part of the friendship graph.

Step 1. Note the friendships among Alice, Bob, and Fran:
  • Alice is friends with Bob and Fran.
  • Bob is friends with Alice and Fran.
Thus, Alice, Bob, and Fran form a triangle, so they must all have different colors.

Step 2. Now look at Dave. The given friendships are:
  • Alice is friends with Dave.
  • Bob is friends with Dave.
  • Carol is friends with Dave.
  • Ethan is friends with Dave.
  • Fran is friends with Dave.
Dave is friends with both Alice, Bob, and Fran. So Dave must get a color different from each of the three already used for Alice, Bob, and Fran. Thus, the four people {Alice, Bob, Dave, Fran} must all have different colors. In other words, they form a complete graph K4 whose coloring requires all 4 colors.

Step 3. Now examine George. By the problem’s friendship list, George is friends with all of the following:
  • Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, and Fran.
In particular, notice that George is friends with all four members of the clique {Alice, Bob, Dave, Fran}. In any proper coloring of a clique of four vertices, all four colors appear. Because George is adjacent to all four, there would be no color left available for him.

Step 4. The same situation occurs with Heather (whose friends include Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, and Fran).

Thus, since at least one vertex (in fact, both George and Heather) is adjacent to a clique that already uses all four colors, there is no way to assign one of the four colors to every person while satisfying the condition.

Final Answer:
Impossible

We will show that no matter how you try to assign the four colors (red, green, blue, yellow) to the eight people while keeping the rule “no one wears the same color as any of their friends,” a proper assignment cannot be made.

One way to see this is to examine a particular part of the friendship graph.

Step 1. Note the friendships among #0, #1, and #5:
  • #0 is friends with #1 and #5.
  • #1 is friends with #0 and #5.
Thus, #0, #1, and #5 form a triangle, so they must all have different colors.

Step 2. Now look at #3. The given friendships are:
  • #0 is friends with #3.
  • #1 is friends with #3.
  • #2 is friends with #3.
  • #4 is friends with #3.
  • #5 is friends with #3.
#3 is friends with both #0, #1, and #5. So #3 must get a color different from each of the three already used for #0, #1, and #5. Thus, the four people {#0, #1, #3, #5} must all have different colors. In other words, they form a complete graph K4 whose coloring requires all 4 colors.

Step 3. Now examine #6. By the problem’s friendship list, #6 is friends with all of the following:
  • #0, #1, #2, #3, #4, and #5.
In particular, notice that #6 is friends with all four members of the clique {#0, #1, #3, #5}. In any proper coloring of a clique of four vertices, all four colors appear. Because #6 is adjacent to all four, there would be no color left available for him.

Step 4. The same situation occurs with #7 (whose friends include #0, #1, #2, #3, #4, and #5).

Thus, since at least one vertex (in fact, both #6 and #7) is adjacent to a clique that already uses all four colors, there is no way to assign one of the four colors to every person while satisfying the condition.

Final Answer:
Impossible
