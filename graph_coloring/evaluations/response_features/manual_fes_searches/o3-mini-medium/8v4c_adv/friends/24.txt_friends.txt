We first show that no matter how one assigns the four colors (red, green, blue, yellow) to the eight people – subject to the rule that any pair of friends must have different colors – there is no way to do so. In fact, if we set up the “friendship graph” with vertices representing the eight people (Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, and Heather) and edges connecting every pair of friends (with friendship assumed to be symmetric), one finds the following list of edges (each edge being mutual):

• Alice is friends with Carol, Dave, Fran, George, and Heather.
• Bob is friends with Carol, Dave, Ethan, George, and Heather.
• Carol is friends with Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, and Heather.
• Dave is friends with Ethan and Fran.
• Ethan is friends with Fran, George, and Heather.

When we make this symmetric the complete list of adjacencies is:
  Alice: {Carol, Dave, Fran, George, Heather}
  Bob: {Carol, Dave, Ethan, George, Heather}
  Carol: {Alice, Bob, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather}
  Dave: {Alice, Bob, Carol, Ethan, Fran}
  Ethan: {Bob, Carol, Dave, Fran, George, Heather}
  Fran: {Alice, Carol, Dave, Ethan}
  George: {Alice, Bob, Carol, Ethan, Heather}
  Heather: {Alice, Bob, Carol, Ethan, George}

Now, if you examine the subgraph induced by the vertices {Bob, Carol, Ethan, George, Heather} you will notice that every pair among these five are friends. For instance:
  – Bob is friends with Carol, Ethan, George, and Heather.
  – Carol is friends with Bob, Ethan, George, and Heather.
  – Ethan is friends with Bob, Carol, George, and Heather.
  – George is friends with Bob, Carol, Ethan, and Heather.
  – Heather is friends with Bob, Carol, Ethan, and George.

Thus these five people form a clique (a complete subgraph) of size 5. Since a clique requires that every vertex be given a different color, any valid coloring would need at least 5 colors.

Because we only have 4 colors available, it is impossible to color the graph so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.

We first show that no matter how one assigns the four colors (red, green, blue, yellow) to the eight people – subject to the rule that any pair of friends must have different colors – there is no way to do so. In fact, if we set up the “friendship graph” with vertices representing the eight people (#0, #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, and #7) and edges connecting every pair of friends (with friendship assumed to be symmetric), one finds the following list of edges (each edge being mutual):

• #0 is friends with #2, #3, #5, #6, and #7.
• #1 is friends with #2, #3, #4, #6, and #7.
• #2 is friends with #3, #4, #5, #6, and #7.
• #3 is friends with #4 and #5.
• #4 is friends with #5, #6, and #7.

When we make this symmetric the complete list of adjacencies is:
  #0: {#2, #3, #5, #6, #7}
  #1: {#2, #3, #4, #6, #7}
  #2: {#0, #1, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7}
  #3: {#0, #1, #2, #4, #5}
  #4: {#1, #2, #3, #5, #6, #7}
  #5: {#0, #2, #3, #4}
  #6: {#0, #1, #2, #4, #7}
  #7: {#0, #1, #2, #4, #6}

Now, if you examine the subgraph induced by the vertices {#1, #2, #4, #6, #7} you will notice that every pair among these five are friends. For instance:
  – #1 is friends with #2, #4, #6, and #7.
  – #2 is friends with #1, #4, #6, and #7.
  – #4 is friends with #1, #2, #6, and #7.
  – #6 is friends with #1, #2, #4, and #7.
  – #7 is friends with #1, #2, #4, and #6.

Thus these five people form a clique (a complete subgraph) of size 5. Since a clique requires that every vertex be given a different color, any valid coloring would need at least 5 colors.
