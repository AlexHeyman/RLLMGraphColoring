Evaluation: impossible incorrect

We can show that no valid assignment exists. In any proper 4‐coloring each vertex must be assigned one of four colors (red, green, blue, yellow) so that no adjacent vertices share the same color.

Notice that the four people Dave, Fran, George, and Heather are all friends with one another. (For example, Dave is friends with Fran, George, and Heather; Fran is friends with George and Heather; and George is friends with Heather.) This means that these four form a clique of size 4—each one must receive a different color.

Now consider Alice. According to the friendships, Alice is friends with Dave, Fran, George, and Heather. Because these four friends already use all four different colors (one for each), there is no remaining color available for Alice that does not conflict with one of her friends.

A similar problem occurs for Bob (who is friends with Carol, Dave, Fran, George, and Heather) because he too is adjacent to the entire clique {Dave, Fran, George, Heather}.

Since we have only four colors available, there is no way to assign colors to all eight people without at least one person ending up with the same color as a friend.

We can show that no valid assignment exists. In any proper 4‐coloring each vertex must be assigned one of four colors (red, green, blue, yellow) so that no adjacent vertices share the same color.

Notice that the four people #3, #5, #6, and #7 are all friends with one another. (For example, #3 is friends with #5, #6, and #7; #5 is friends with #6 and #7; and #6 is friends with #7.) This means that these four form a clique of size 4—each one must receive a different color.

Now consider #0. According to the friendships, #0 is friends with #3, #5, #6, and #7. Because these four friends already use all four different colors (one for each), there is no remaining color available for #0 that does not conflict with one of her friends.

A similar problem occurs for #1 (who is friends with #2, #3, #5, #6, and #7) because he too is adjacent to the entire clique {#3, #5, #6, #7}.

Since we have only four colors available, there is no way to assign colors to all eight people without at least one person ending up with the same color as a friend.
