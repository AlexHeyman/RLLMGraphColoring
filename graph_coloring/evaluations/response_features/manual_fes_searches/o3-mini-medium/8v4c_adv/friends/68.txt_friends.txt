We will show that no matter how you try to assign the four colors, some person will end up having a friend with the same color. In fact, one may prove that there is no valid 4‐coloring of the “friendship graph” that has vertices

 Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather

with edges given by:

 • Alice is friends with Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, and Heather.
 • Bob is friends with Carol, George, and Heather.
 • Carol is friends with Dave, Fran, George, and Heather.
 • Dave is friends with Ethan and Heather.
 • Ethan is friends with George and Heather.
 • Fran is friends with George and Heather.

Notice in particular that Heather is friends with all the other 7 people. This means Heather’s color must differ from every one of the others’ colors. Since there are only 4 colors available, the 7 people (everyone except Heather) may use at most 3 distinct colors in any valid assignment (so that Heather can use the fourth color).

Now look at the subgraph induced by everyone except Heather (that is, the vertices A, B, C, D, E, F, and G). Because Alice is friends with each of the other six among these, Alice’s color must differ from all six. Therefore, the six vertices {Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George} must get only 2 colors (none equal to Alice’s) if the whole set of 7 is to use only 3 colors. However, observe that among these six there is a triangle formed by Bob, Carol, and George (since Bob is friends with Carol and George, and Carol is friends with George). A triangle cannot be 2‑colored (it needs 3 colors). This contradiction shows that the six vertices cannot be assigned only 2 colors.

Because it is impossible to color the 7 vertices (neighbors of Heather) with at most 3 colors, Heather will always see all four colors among her friends, leaving no color available for herself.

Thus, there is no way to assign the 4 shirt colors so that no one wears the same color as any friend.

We will show that no matter how you try to assign the four colors, some person will end up having a friend with the same color. In fact, one may prove that there is no valid 4‐coloring of the “friendship graph” that has vertices

 #0, #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7

with edges given by:

 • #0 is friends with #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, and #7.
 • #1 is friends with #2, #6, and #7.
 • #2 is friends with #3, #5, #6, and #7.
 • #3 is friends with #4 and #7.
 • #4 is friends with #6 and #7.
 • #5 is friends with #6 and #7.

Notice in particular that #7 is friends with all the other 7 people. This means #7’s color must differ from every one of the others’ colors. Since there are only 4 colors available, the 7 people (everyone except #7) may use at most 3 distinct colors in any valid assignment (so that #7 can use the fourth color).

Now look at the subgraph induced by everyone except #7 (that is, the vertices A, B, C, D, E, F, and G). Because #0 is friends with each of the other six among these, #0’s color must differ from all six. Therefore, the six vertices {#1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6} must get only 2 colors (none equal to #0’s) if the whole set of 7 is to use only 3 colors. However, observe that among these six there is a triangle formed by #1, #2, and #6 (since #1 is friends with #2 and #6, and #2 is friends with #6). A triangle cannot be 2‑colored (it needs 3 colors). This contradiction shows that the six vertices cannot be assigned only 2 colors.

Because it is impossible to color the 7 vertices (neighbors of #7) with at most 3 colors, #7 will always see all four colors among her friends, leaving no color available for herself.

Thus, there is no way to assign the 4 shirt colors so that no one wears the same color as any friend.
