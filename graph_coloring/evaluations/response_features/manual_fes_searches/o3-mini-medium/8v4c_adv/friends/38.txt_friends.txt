We show that no assignment of red, green, blue, and yellow shirts to Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, and Heather can avoid a conflict on every friendship.

Let’s label the 8 people by their initials:

 A = Alice, B = Bob, C = Carol, D = Dave, E = Ethan, F = Fran, G = George, H = Heather.

The given friendships (i.e. “edges” between people) are:

 A with C, D, E, G, H  
 B with C, E, F, G, H  
 C with E, F, G, H   (in addition to A and B)  
 D with E, F      (in addition to A)  
 E with G, H      (in addition to A, B, C, D)  
 F with G, H      (in addition to B, C, D)  
 G with H       (in addition to A, B, C, E, F)  
 H with … (has the above as neighbors)

An important observation is the subgraph induced by H’s neighbors. Heather is friends with A, B, C, E, F, and G. In these six people one set of four appears as a clique (i.e. every two are friends):

 B, C, E, and G.

To see this, check that:
 • B is friends with C, E, and G.
 • C is friends with B, E, and G.
 • E is friends with B, C, and G.
 • G is friends with B, C, and E.

In any proper coloring (one where adjacent vertices have different colors), a clique of size 4 must use four distinct colors (one per vertex). That means that in any valid assignment the people B, C, E, and G must be given all four different colors.

Now, because Heather (H) is friends with each of B, C, E, and G, she finds that all four shirt colors appear on her friends. Since no one wants to wear the same color as a friend, Heather would be unable to pick any of the four colors and would have no available color.

Thus, there is no way to assign one of the four colors—red, green, blue, or yellow—to all eight people so that any two friends wear different colors.

We show that no assignment of red, green, blue, and yellow shirts to #0, #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, and #7 can avoid a conflict on every friendship.

Let’s label the 8 people by their initials:

 A = #0, B = #1, C = #2, D = #3, E = #4, F = #5, G = #6, H = #7.

The given friendships (i.e. “edges” between people) are:

 A with C, D, E, G, H  
 B with C, E, F, G, H  
 C with E, F, G, H   (in addition to A and B)

 F with G, H      (in addition to B, C, D)  
 G with H       (in addition to A, B, C, E, F)  
 H with … (has the above as neighbors)

An important observation is the subgraph induced by H’s neighbors. #7 is friends with A, B, C, E, F, and G. In these six people one set of four appears as a clique (i.e. every two are friends):

 B, C, E, and G.

To see this, check that:
 • B is friends with C, E, and G.
 • C is friends with B, E, and G.
 • E is friends with B, C, and G.
 • G is friends with B, C, and E.

In any proper coloring (one where adjacent vertices have different colors), a clique of size 4 must use four distinct colors (one per vertex). That means that in any valid assignment the people B, C, E, and G must be given all four different colors.

Now, because #7 (H) is friends with each of B, C, E, and G, she finds that all four shirt colors appear on her friends. Since no one wants to wear the same color as a friend, #7 would be unable to pick any of the four colors and would have no available color.
