We first model the situation as a graph. The vertices are the 8 people, and an edge connects two people if they are friends. The given friendships are:

• Alice: friends with Bob, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather  
• Bob: friends with Alice, Carol, Dave, Ethan, George, Heather  
• Carol: friends with Bob, Ethan, George, Heather  
• Dave: friends with Alice, Bob, Fran  
• Ethan: friends with Alice, Bob, Carol, Fran, George, Heather  
• Fran: friends with Alice, Dave, Ethan, George, Heather  
• George: friends with Alice, Bob, Carol, Ethan, Fran, Heather  
• Heather: friends with Alice, Bob, Carol, Ethan, Fran, George

Now, note that among these vertices there is a complete subgraph (a clique) on {Alice, Bob, Ethan, Heather}. (Every pair from these four are friends: for example, Alice is friends with Bob, Ethan, and Heather; Bob is friends with Ethan and Heather; and Ethan is friends with Heather.) In any proper coloring of a clique, each vertex must be given a different color—so if we have 4 colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow) then the clique forces Alice, Bob, Ethan, and Heather to take all 4 different colors.

Look now at George. Its neighbors are:  
Alice, Bob, Carol, Ethan, Fran, and Heather.

No matter how we assign the colors to the clique {Alice, Bob, Ethan, Heather} (all four different colors), George finds that among its neighbors the colors Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow are all present. Even if you try to “save” a color by carefully choosing colors for Carol and Fran, the four clique members already cover all 4 colors. This means that any choice for George would conflict with one of its neighbors—a proper coloring requires that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.

Thus, there is no way to assign one of the four colors to each person so that friends (adjacent vertices) do not wear the same color.

We first model the situation as a graph. The vertices are the 8 people, and an edge connects two people if they are friends. The given friendships are:

• #0: friends with #1, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7  
• #1: friends with #0, #2, #3, #4, #6, #7  
• #2: friends with #1, #4, #6, #7  
• #3: friends with #0, #1, #5  
• #4: friends with #0, #1, #2, #5, #6, #7  
• #5: friends with #0, #3, #4, #6, #7  
• #6: friends with #0, #1, #2, #4, #5, #7  
• #7: friends with #0, #1, #2, #4, #5, #6

Now, note that among these vertices there is a complete subgraph (a clique) on {#0, #1, #4, #7}. (Every pair from these four are friends: for example, #0 is friends with #1, #4, and #7; #1 is friends with #4 and #7; and #4 is friends with #7.) In any proper coloring of a clique, each vertex must be given a different color—so if we have 4 colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow) then the clique forces #0, #1, #4, and #7 to take all 4 different colors.

Look now at #6. Its neighbors are:  
#0, #1, #2, #4, #5, and #7.

No matter how we assign the colors to the clique {#0, #1, #4, #7} (all four different colors), #6 finds that among its neighbors the colors Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow are all present. Even if you try to “save” a color by carefully choosing colors for #2 and #5, the four clique members already cover all 4 colors. This means that any choice for #6 would conflict with one of its neighbors—a proper coloring requires that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.

Thus, there is no way to assign one of the four colors to each person so that friends (adjacent vertices) do not wear the same color.
