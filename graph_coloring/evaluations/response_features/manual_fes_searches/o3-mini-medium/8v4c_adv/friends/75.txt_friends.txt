We will show that no matter how you assign the four colors (red, green, blue, yellow) to the eight people, there is no assignment that avoids a conflict between friends.

Let’s first list the given friendships among the eight people:

• Alice is friends with Bob, Ethan, George, and Heather.
• Bob is friends with Alice, Carol, Dave, Ethan, George, and Heather.
• Carol is friends with Bob, Dave, Fran, and Heather.
• Dave is friends with Bob, Carol, Ethan, Fran, George, and Heather.
• Ethan is friends with Alice, Bob, Dave, George, and Heather.
• Fran is friends with Carol, Dave, George, and Heather.
• George is friends with Alice, Bob, Dave, Ethan, Fran, and Heather.
• Heather is friends with Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, and George.

Notice in particular the following subgroup: Bob, Dave, George, and Heather are all pairwise friends with each other. (That is, Bob is friends with Dave, George, and Heather; Dave is friends with Bob, George, and Heather; etc.) In any proper coloring, every vertex in a clique must receive a different color. Since we have 4 colors available, this subgroup must use four different colors.

Now consider Ethan. In addition to any other friendships, Ethan is also friends with Bob, Dave, George, and Heather. That means Ethan is adjacent to all four persons in the 4‑clique mentioned above. Since those four people have already “used” all 4 colors (each one with a different color), there is no color left for Ethan that is different from all of his friends. In other words, the induced subgraph on {Heather, Bob, Dave, George, Ethan} forms a clique of size 5. (A clique of 5 vertices requires at least 5 colors in any proper vertex coloring.)

Thus there is no way to assign four colors so that no two friends share the same color.

We will show that no matter how you assign the four colors (red, green, blue, yellow) to the eight people, there is no assignment that avoids a conflict between friends.

Let’s first list the given friendships among the eight people:

• #0 is friends with #1, #4, #6, and #7.
• #1 is friends with #0, #2, #3, #4, #6, and #7.
• #2 is friends with #1, #3, #5, and #7.
• #3 is friends with #1, #2, #4, #5, #6, and #7.
• #4 is friends with #0, #1, #3, #6, and #7.
• #5 is friends with #2, #3, #6, and #7.
• #6 is friends with #0, #1, #3, #4, #5, and #7.
• #7 is friends with #0, #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, and #6.

Notice in particular the following subgroup: #1, #3, #6, and #7 are all pairwise friends with each other. (That is, #1 is friends with #3, #6, and #7; #3 is friends with #1, #6, and #7; etc.) In any proper coloring, every vertex in a clique must receive a different color. Since we have 4 colors available, this subgroup must use four different colors.

Now consider #4. In addition to any other friendships, #4 is also friends with #1, #3, #6, and #7. That means #4 is adjacent to all four persons in the 4‑clique mentioned above. Since those four people have already “used” all 4 colors (each one with a different color), there is no color left for #4 that is different from all of his friends. In other words, the induced subgraph on {#7, #1, #3, #6, #4} forms a clique of size 5. (A clique of 5 vertices requires at least 5 colors in any proper vertex coloring.)

Thus there is no way to assign four colors so that no two friends share the same color.
