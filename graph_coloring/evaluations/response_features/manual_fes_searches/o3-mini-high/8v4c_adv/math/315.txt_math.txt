Edges: [(0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 6), (5, 7)]

We first check the structure of the graph. Its vertices are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, and the listed edges are:

  (0,2), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7)  
  (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7)  
  (2,3), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7)  
  (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7)  
  (4,5), (4,6), (4,7)  
  (5,6), (5,7)  
  (6,7)

A quick look reveals that many pairs of vertices are adjacent—in fact, the only missing edges among what would be a complete graph on 8 vertices are (0,1), (0,3), (1,3), and (2,4).

Now, a proper coloring with four colors is possible only if the largest clique in the graph has size at most 4. (Recall that a clique is a set of vertices every pair of which are adjacent, and any clique must get different colors in any proper vertex coloring.)

Examine the subgraph induced by vertices {2, 5, 6, 7}. They are all mutually adjacent:
  – (2,5), (2,6), (2,7) appear in the list.  
  – (5,6), (5,7), (6,7) are also present.

This set forms a K4. Notice that vertex 0 is adjacent to every vertex in that K4 because the edges (0,2), (0,5), (0,6), and (0,7) are present. Thus, the set {0, 2, 5, 6, 7} is a clique of size 5. (A similar clique can be found by using vertex 1 or 3 in place of 0.)

Since any clique of size 5 requires five different colors to color its vertices (each vertex must receive a unique color), it is impossible to color the graph properly using only four colors.
