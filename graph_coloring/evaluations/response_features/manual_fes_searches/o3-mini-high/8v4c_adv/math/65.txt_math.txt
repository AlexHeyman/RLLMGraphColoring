We will show that any valid vertex‐coloring using only Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow would require at least five different colors. (Thus, a 4‑coloring is impossible.)

Notice that vertices 0, 4, 5, and 6 form a clique. In the graph the edges (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (4,5), (4,6), and (5,6) are all present, so these four vertices are pairwise adjacent. Therefore, they must each receive a different color.

Now look at vertex 7. Its neighbor set is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. In particular, vertex 7 is adjacent to all of 0, 4, 5, and 6. Since 0, 4, 5, and 6 already use four different colors (one for each, due to being a clique), there is no color left for vertex 7. (In fact, {0,4,5,6,7} forms a clique of size 5, which immediately forces the need for at least 5 colors.)

Thus, no assignment of the four given colors to all eight vertices can avoid having at least one pair of adjacent vertices sharing the same color.
