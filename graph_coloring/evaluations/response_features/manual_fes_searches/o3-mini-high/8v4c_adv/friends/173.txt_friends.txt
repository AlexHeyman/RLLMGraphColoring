We begin by listing the friends (remember, friendship is mutual):

• Alice: Bob, Carol, Dave, George, Heather  
• Bob: Alice, Carol, Fran, Heather  
• Carol: Alice, Bob, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather  
• Dave: Alice, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather  
• Ethan: Carol, Dave, Fran, George, Heather  
• Fran: Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, George, Heather  
• George: Alice, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, Heather  
• Heather: Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George

Now, notice the set {Heather, Carol, Fran, George, Ethan}. Check that every pair in this set is friends:
 – Heather is friends with Carol, Fran, George, and Ethan.
 – Carol is friends with Fran, George, and Ethan.
 – Fran is friends with Carol, George, and Ethan.
 – George is friends with Carol, Fran, and Ethan.
 – Ethan is friends with Carol, Fran, and George.
Thus these five people form a clique (a complete subgraph).

A clique of five vertices requires five different colors to ensure that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. Since only four shirt colors (red, green, blue, yellow) are available, it is impossible to color (or, in the party scenario, have each person wear a shirt of a color different from all of their friends) the graph with just four colors.

We begin by listing the friends (remember, friendship is mutual):

• #0: #1, #2, #3, #6, #7  
• #1: #0, #2, #5, #7  
• #2: #0, #1, #4, #5, #6, #7

• #4: #2, #3, #5, #6, #7  
• #5: #1, #2, #3, #4, #6, #7  
• #6: #0, #2, #3, #4, #5, #7  
• #7: #0, #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6

Now, notice the set {#7, #2, #5, #6, #4}. Check that every pair in this set is friends:
 – #7 is friends with #2, #5, #6, and #4.
 – #2 is friends with #5, #6, and #4.
 – #5 is friends with #2, #6, and #4.
 – #6 is friends with #2, #5, and #4.
 – #4 is friends with #2, #5, and #6.
