We will show that no assignment of four colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow) can work. In fact, one can prove that the friendship graph in question contains a clique of size 5.

One way to see this is to list the friends of each person. For example, note that Heather’s friends are
  Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, and George.
Among these, one can check that the four people Carol, Dave, Ethan, and George are all mutually friends:
 • Carol is friends with Dave, Ethan, and George.
 • Dave is friends with Ethan and George.
 • Ethan is friends with George.

Thus the set {Heather, Carol, Dave, Ethan, George} forms a clique of five—every two different people in this set are friends with each other. In any proper coloring of a graph, every vertex in a clique must receive a different color. This clique of size 5 forces five different colors on its members. However, only four colors are available.

Because it is impossible to assign five different colors using just four options, no acceptable assignment exists.

Among these, one can check that the four people #2, #3, #4, and #6 are all mutually friends:
 • #2 is friends with #3, #4, and #6.

Thus the set {#7, #2, #3, #4, #6} forms a clique of five—every two different people in this set are friends with each other.
