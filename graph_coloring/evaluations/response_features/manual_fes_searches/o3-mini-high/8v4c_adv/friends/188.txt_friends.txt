Evaluation: impossible incorrect

We can show that a proper assignment of four colors is impossible. Notice that the following five people must all be assigned different colors since every pair among them are friends:

  Alice, Carol, Dave, Fran, Heather

For example, Alice is friends with Carol, Dave, Fran, and Heather; Carol is friends with Dave, Fran, and Heather; Dave is friends with Fran and Heather; and Fran is friends with Heather. Since these five people form a clique (each is directly connected to every other), they would require five different colors. But only four colors (red, green, blue, and yellow) are available.

We can show that a proper assignment of four colors is impossible. Notice that the following five people must all be assigned different colors since every pair among them are friends:

  #0, #2, #3, #5, #7

For example, #0 is friends with #2, #3, #5, and #7; #2 is friends with #3, #5, and #7; #3 is friends with #5 and #7; and #5 is friends with #7. Since these five people form a clique (each is directly connected to every other), they would require five different colors. But only four colors (red, green, blue, and yellow) are available.
