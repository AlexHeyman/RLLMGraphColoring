We begin by representing each person as a vertex in a graph and drawing an edge between two vertices if those people are friends. The friendship relationships are:

 • Alice – Bob, Carol, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather  
 • Bob – (in addition to Alice) Dave, Fran, George, Heather  
 • Carol – (in addition to Alice) Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather  
 • Dave – (in addition to Bob and Carol) Ethan, George, Heather  
 • Ethan – (in addition to Alice, Carol, Dave) George, Heather  
 • Fran – (in addition to Alice, Bob, Carol) George, Heather  
 • George – friends with everyone except for no one (all 7 others)  
 • Heather – friends with everyone (all 7 others)

Notice that George and Heather are connected to every other vertex, so in any valid shirt–coloring the colors used by George and Heather cannot appear on any of the other 6 people.

Since we have only four colors available (red, green, blue, yellow), assigning distinct colors to George and Heather uses 2 of that set. That leaves only 2 colors available for the remaining 6 people.

Moreover, every one of the remaining people (Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran) is friends with both George and Heather so none of them may use the colors chosen by George and Heather. In other words, they are forced to choose from only two colors.

Now examine the induced subgraph on these 6 vertices. Their mutual friendship relations include:
 • Alice is friends with Bob, Carol, Ethan, Fran.
 • Bob is friends with Alice, Dave, Fran.
 • Carol is friends with Alice, Dave, Ethan, Fran.
 • Dave is friends with Bob, Carol, Ethan.
 • Ethan is friends with Alice, Carol, Dave.
 • Fran is friends with Alice, Bob, Carol.

In particular, notice that Alice, Carol, and Fran are all mutually connected (each pair is friends). This forms a triangle, which is an odd cycle. A graph with an odd cycle cannot be properly colored using only 2 colors (i.e. it is not bipartite).

Because the 6 vertices must be colored with only 2 colors (due to the restrictions imposed by their friendships with George and Heather), and the triangle forces a need for 3 different colors on those vertices, there is no way to assign the four shirt colors so that no pair of friends wears the same color.

We begin by representing each person as a vertex in a graph and drawing an edge between two vertices if those people are friends. The friendship relationships are:

 • #0 – #1, #2, #4, #5, #6, #7  
 • #1 – (in addition to #0) #3, #5, #6, #7  
 • #2 – (in addition to #0) #3, #4, #5, #6, #7  
 • #3 – (in addition to #1 and #2) #4, #6, #7  
 • #4 – (in addition to #0, #2, #3) #6, #7  
 • #5 – (in addition to #0, #1, #2) #6, #7  
 • #6 – friends with everyone except for no one (all 7 others)  
 • #7 – friends with everyone (all 7 others)

Notice that #6 and #7 are connected to every other vertex, so in any valid shirt–coloring the colors used by #6 and #7 cannot appear on any of the other 6 people.

Since we have only four colors available (red, green, blue, yellow), assigning distinct colors to #6 and #7 uses 2 of that set. That leaves only 2 colors available for the remaining 6 people.

Moreover, every one of the remaining people (#0, #1, #2, #3, #4, #5) is friends with both #6 and #7 so none of them may use the colors chosen by #6 and #7. In other words, they are forced to choose from only two colors.

Now examine the induced subgraph on these 6 vertices. Their mutual friendship relations include:
 • #0 is friends with #1, #2, #4, #5.
 • #1 is friends with #0, #3, #5.
 • #2 is friends with #0, #3, #4, #5.
 • #3 is friends with #1, #2, #4.
 • #4 is friends with #0, #2, #3.
 • #5 is friends with #0, #1, #2.

In particular, notice that #0, #2, and #5 are all mutually connected (each pair is friends). This forms a triangle, which is an odd cycle. A graph with an odd cycle cannot be properly colored using only 2 colors (i.e. it is not bipartite).

Because the 6 vertices must be colored with only 2 colors (due to the restrictions imposed by their friendships with #6 and #7), and the triangle forces a need for 3 different colors on those vertices, there is no way to assign the four shirt colors so that no pair of friends wears the same color.
