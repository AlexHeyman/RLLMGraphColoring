One way to see why this is impossible is to examine the structure of the “friendship graph.”

Notice that Alice is friends with everyone else. In addition, the following four people:

 • Bob  
 • Fran  
 • George  
 • Heather

are all mutually friends with one another (for instance, Bob is friends with Fran, George, and Heather; Fran is friends with Bob, George, and Heather; etc.). This means that the set {Alice, Bob, Fran, George, Heather} forms a clique—a complete subgraph in which every pair of individuals are friends.

In any proper coloring (where no two adjacent vertices share the same color), every person in a clique must have a distinct color. Since this clique contains 5 people, you would need at least 5 different colors. However, only 4 colors (red, green, blue, yellow) are available.
