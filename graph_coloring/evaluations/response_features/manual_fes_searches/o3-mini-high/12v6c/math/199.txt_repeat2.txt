We first note that a proper vertex–coloring with the six colors (red, green, blue, yellow, orange, purple) is possible only if the graph’s chromatic number is at most 6. (In any proper coloring, every clique must receive all different colors—so if the graph contains a clique on k vertices, then at least k colors are needed.)

A close look at the given edge–set reveals that vertex 11 is adjacent to every other vertex, so a clique that uses vertex 11 will be one larger than any clique formed solely on the remaining vertices.

In fact, observe the following six vertices:
  3, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10.
From the given edges one may verify:
 – Vertex 3 is adjacent to 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10.
 – Vertex 5 is adjacent to 3, 6, 7, 9, and 10.
 – Vertex 6 is adjacent to 3, 5, 7, 9, and 10.
 – Vertex 7 is adjacent to 3, 5, 6, 9, and 10.
 – Vertex 9 is adjacent to 3, 5, 6, 7, and 10.
 – Vertex 10 is adjacent to 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9.
Thus, these six vertices form a clique (each pair is connected).

Since vertex 11 is adjacent to every vertex, if we add vertex 11 to this set we obtain the set {3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11} which is a clique of size 7. (You can check, for example, that the edge (3,11) is present, as are (5,11), (6,11), (7,11), (9,11), and (10,11).)

Any proper coloring must assign all 7 vertices in a clique different colors. But we have only 6 colors available.

Therefore, it is impossible to color the vertices with the six given colors so that adjacent vertices receive different colors.
