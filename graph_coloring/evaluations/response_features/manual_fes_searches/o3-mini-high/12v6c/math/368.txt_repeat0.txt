We will show that no proper coloring using exactly these 6 colors (red, green, blue, yellow, orange, purple) exists.

In what follows the “graph” has 12 vertices (0–11) with the given edges. A close look shows that vertex 11 is “universal” – it is adjacent to every vertex 0–10. (In fact, the edge‐list has (0,11), (1,11), …, (10,11).) That means whatever colors are used on vertices 0–10 must all differ from the color assigned to 11.

One might hope to “save a color” on vertices 0–10 (i.e. use only 5 colors) so that vertex 11 could share one of them. However, one may prove that the induced subgraph on {0, 1, …, 10} is itself “6‐chromatic.”

A quick explanation is as follows. (Some of these facts can be verified by examining the edge–list.)

• First, one may verify that if you look at the seven vertices {1,2,3,4,5,6,7} the following is true:
 – Every vertex in {1,2,3,4,5,6,7} is adjacent (in the induced subgraph on {1,…,7}) to every other except for two “gaps”: 
  – There is no edge connecting vertex 2 and vertex 5.
  – There is no edge connecting vertex 3 and vertex 4.
 In any proper coloring the best you can do is “reuse” a color on the one nonadjacent pair (say, give 2 and 5 the same color and also give 3 and 4 the same color). But then by a short checking one finds that even with the best “recycling” the vertices in {1,2,3,4,5,6,7} require 5 distinct colors.

• Next, examine vertex 9. Its neighbors (in the induced subgraph on 0–10) are exactly {1,2,3,4,5,6,7} (note that the edge (0,9) is missing and neither are 8 nor 10 adjacent to 9). Therefore no matter how you 5–color {1,2,3,4,5,6,7} there will be 5 different colors present on the neighbors of 9. That forces vertex 9 to receive a color different from those 5—that is, a “6th” color.

Even if one can then assign colors to 0, 8, and 10 using some of the 6 colors already chosen, the vertices 0–10 as a whole will “use” all 6 colors. Then vertex 11 (which is adjacent to every one of 0–10) cannot be given any of the 6 colors (since its color must differ from every color appearing on its neighbors) and would require a seventh color.

Since only the six listed colors (red, green, blue, yellow, orange, purple) are available, no valid proper coloring exists.
