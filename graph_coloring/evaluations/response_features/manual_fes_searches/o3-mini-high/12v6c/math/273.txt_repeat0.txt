We begin by noticing that any proper vertex‐coloring requires that every clique (a complete subgraph) get as many different colors as its number of vertices. In other words, if the graph has a clique of size k then at least k colors are needed. (Two adjacent vertices must have different colors.)

In our graph, examine the vertices {1, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11}. Check that every pair among these seven vertices is joined by an edge:

• 1 is adjacent to 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, and 11.
• 4 is adjacent to 1, 6, 7, 9, 10, and 11.
• 6 is adjacent to 1, 4, 7, 9, 10, and 11.
• 7 is adjacent to 1, 4, 6, 9, 10, and 11.
• 9 is adjacent to 1, 4, 6, 7, 10, and 11.
• 10 is adjacent to 1, 4, 6, 7, 9, and 11.
• 11 is adjacent to 1, 4, 6, 7, 9, and 10.

Since every vertex in this set is adjacent to every other vertex in the set, they form a clique of size 7. This clique forces us to use 7 different colors. However, we only have 6 colors available: Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Orange, and Purple.

Thus, it is impossible to properly color the graph with the 6 given colors.
