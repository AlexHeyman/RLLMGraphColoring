We first check for a large clique. (A clique is a set of vertices every two of which are joined by an edge.) If our graph contained a clique of size 7, then any proper coloring must use at least 7 colors—one per vertex in the clique. Since we only have six colors (red, green, blue, yellow, orange, purple), a 7‑clique would make a 6‑coloring impossible.

Examine the vertices {0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 9, 11}:

• 0 is adjacent to 1, 3, 5, 6, 9, 11 (edges (0,1), (0,3), (0,5), (0,6), (0,9), (0,11)).

• 1 is adjacent to 0, 3, 5, 6, 9, 11 (edges (0,1), (1,3), (1,5), (1,6), (1,9), (1,11)).

• 3 is adjacent to 0, 1, 5, 6, 9, 11 (edges (0,3), (1,3), (3,5), (3,6), (3,9), (3,11)).

• 5 is adjacent to 0, 1, 3, 6, 9, 11 (edges (0,5), (1,5), (3,5), (5,6), (5,9), (5,11)).

• 6 is adjacent to 0, 1, 3, 5, 9, 11 (edges (0,6), (1,6), (3,6), (5,6), (6,9), (6,11)).

• 9 is adjacent to 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 11 (edges (0,9), (1,9), (3,9), (5,9), (6,9), (9,11)).

• 11 is adjacent to 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 9 (edges (0,11), (1,11), (3,11), (5,11), (6,11), (9,11)).

Since all pairs of these vertices are joined by an edge, they form a clique of size 7.

A clique of size 7 requires 7 different colors. As only 6 colors are available, it is impossible to color the graph so that no adjacent vertices share the same color.
