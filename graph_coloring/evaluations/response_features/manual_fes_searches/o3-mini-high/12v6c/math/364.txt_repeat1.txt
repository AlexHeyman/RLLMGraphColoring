We will show that no proper assignment of the six colors (red, green, blue, yellow, orange, purple) to the 12 vertices exists.

A look at the edge list reveals that the vertices {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7} form a clique (each pair of these vertices is adjacent). In any proper coloring the vertices of a clique must all receive different colors, so these six vertices must “use up” all six colors in some order.

Now observe the following facts:
• Vertex 6 is adjacent to vertices 0, 2, 4, 5, and 7.
• Vertex 10 is also adjacent to vertices 0, 2, 4, 5, and 7.

Since the clique {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7} uses all six colors, the five–vertex set {0, 2, 4, 5, 7} gets five different colors. Thus any vertex that is adjacent to all of 0, 2, 4, 5, and 7 may not use those five colors and is forced to take the one “left‐over” color. (Note that although vertex 1 is the “sixth” member of the clique, neither vertex 6 nor vertex 10 is adjacent to 1, so their “pool” of forbidden colors is exactly the five colors used on {0,2,4,5,7}.)

This argument forces both 6 and 10 to be colored with the same “remaining” color. However, the edge list shows that there is an edge between 6 and 10. Thus they would end up with the same color even though they are adjacent—a contradiction.

Because the structure of the graph forces a clash under any assignment with only six colors, we must conclude that a proper 6‐coloring is impossible.

Impossible
