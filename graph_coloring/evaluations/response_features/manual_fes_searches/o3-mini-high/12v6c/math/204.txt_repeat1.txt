Evaluation: impossible incorrect

After much analysis it turns out that no matter how one tries to assign six different colors to the 12 vertices, one always ends up “trapping” at least one vertex – usually because one vertex’s neighbors force all six colors to appear. In other words, any proper coloring of this graph would require at least seven colors. 

The many attempts to “compress” the color‐set (for example by trying to have the nine neighbors of vertex 11 use only five colors, or trying to color the “triangle” induced by vertices 5, 6, and 8 while keeping the other parts very economical) all lead to unavoidable conflicts. In every strategy one finds that some vertex (often vertex 11 or vertex 9) ends up with all six colors already appearing among its neighbors.

Thus, it is impossible to color every vertex red, green, blue, yellow, orange, or purple so that no two adjacent vertices receive the same color.
