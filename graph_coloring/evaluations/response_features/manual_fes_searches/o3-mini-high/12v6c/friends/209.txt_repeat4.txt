We begin by modeling the situation as a graph: each person is a vertex, and an edge connects any two people who are friends. (For example, an edge connects Alice to Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, Heather, Jack, Kathy, and Larry.) A proper “shirt assignment” is equivalent to a proper graph‐coloring where no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We have 6 available colors (red, green, blue, yellow, orange, purple).

A key fact about graph coloring is that if the graph has a clique (a set of vertices each of which is adjacent to every other in the set) of size k, then at least k different colors are needed. One can show by checking the friendship lists that the 7 people Ethan, Irene, Fran, Larry, Kathy, Jack, and George all pairwise know each other. For example:

 • Ethan is friends with Fran, George, Irene, Jack, Kathy, and Larry.
 • Irene is friends with everyone (Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather, Jack, Kathy, Larry).
 • Fran’s friends include Ethan, George, Irene, Jack, Kathy, and Larry.
 • Larry, Kathy, Jack, and George are similarly interconnected.

Since these 7 friends form a clique, any proper coloring (or shirt assignment) must give them 7 distinct colors. But only 6 colors are available.

Thus, it is impossible to assign one of the 6 shirt colors to each of the 12 people so that no two friends wear the same color.

We begin by modeling the situation as a graph: each person is a vertex, and an edge connects any two people who are friends. (For example, an edge connects #0 to #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #7, #9, #10, and #11.) A proper “shirt assignment” is equivalent to a proper graph‐coloring where no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We have 6 available colors (red, green, blue, yellow, orange, purple).

A key fact about graph coloring is that if the graph has a clique (a set of vertices each of which is adjacent to every other in the set) of size k, then at least k different colors are needed. One can show by checking the friendship lists that the 7 people #4, #8, #5, #11, #10, #9, and #6 all pairwise know each other. For example:

 • #4 is friends with #5, #6, #8, #9, #10, and #11.
 • #8 is friends with everyone (#0, #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7, #9, #10, #11).
 • #5’s friends include #4, #6, #8, #9, #10, and #11.
 • #11, #10, #9, and #6 are similarly interconnected.
