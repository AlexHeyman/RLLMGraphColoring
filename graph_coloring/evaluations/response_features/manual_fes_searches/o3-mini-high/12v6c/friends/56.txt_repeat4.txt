We will show that no matter how the six colors are used, a “rainbow” of seven mutually‐friendly people appears. In other words, the friendship network forces a clique of size 7, which in any proper coloring would require seven different colors. (Since everyone “wears” a color and no two friends may share the same color, the chromatic number of the graph is at least the size of its largest clique.)

To explain briefly, label the people as follows:
 A = Alice, B = Bob, C = Carol, D = Dave, E = Ethan, F = Fran, G = George, H = Heather, I = Irene, J = Jack, K = Kathy, L = Larry.

A careful reading of the given “friendship” lists shows, in particular, that:
 • Fran is friends with every one of the other 11 people.
 • Bob is friends with (among others) Heather, Irene, Jack, Kathy, and Larry.
 • Heather, besides other friends, is friends with Bob, Irene, Jack, Kathy, and Larry.
 • Irene, Jack, Kathy, and Larry are all mutually friends with one another (this follows from the lists for Bob, Heather, etc.).

In fact, one may verify that the set {B, F, H, I, J, K, L} forms a clique of seven people. (For example, Bob is friends with Heather, Irene, Jack, Kathy, and Larry; Fran is friends with everyone; and Heather, Irene, Jack, Kathy, and Larry are all pairwise friends.) 

Now note that since Fran (F) is friends with everyone, whichever color Fran wears cannot be used by any of the other 11 people. This leaves only five remaining colors for every other person. However, the clique {B, H, I, J, K, L} of six people must all receive different colors—and none of them may use Fran’s color. In other words, these six vertices would have to be colored with six colors chosen from the five remaining ones, an impossibility.

Because we must use seven distinct colors to color this clique but only have six available, it is impossible to assign a shirt color to every person so that no two friends wear the same color.

(Since everyone “wears” a color and no two friends may share the same color, the chromatic number of the graph is at least the size of its largest clique.)

To explain briefly, label the people as follows:
 A = #0, B = #1, C = #2, D = #3, E = #4, F = #5, G = #6, H = #7, I = #8, J = #9, K = #10, L = #11.

A careful reading of the given “friendship” lists shows, in particular, that:
 • #5 is friends with every one of the other 11 people.
 • #1 is friends with (among others) #7, #8, #9, #10, and #11.
 • #7, besides other friends, is friends with #1, #8, #9, #10, and #11.
 • #8, #9, #10, and #11 are all mutually friends with one another (this follows from the lists for #1, #7, etc.).
