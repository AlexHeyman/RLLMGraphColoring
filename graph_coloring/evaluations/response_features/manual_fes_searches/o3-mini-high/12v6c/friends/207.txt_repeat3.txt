We will show that no matter how the six shirt‐colors (red, green, blue, yellow, orange, purple) are distributed, some pair of friends must end up with the same color.

A careful look at the friendship list reveals that two people— Irene and Larry—are “universal”: each is friends with every one of the other 11 people. (For example, Irene is listed as friends with Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather, Jack, Kathy, and Larry, and similarly Larry is friends with everyone else.) Because Irene is friends with every other person, no one else at the party may wear the same shirt‐color as Irene; and similarly no one else may wear Larry’s shirt color. Thus, if we had six colors in total, the remaining 10 people (everyone except Irene and Larry) would be forced to choose their colors from only the 4 colors not used by Irene and Larry.

However, one may check that among these 10 people the following five form a clique (i.e. every one of them is friends with every other one in the group): Alice, Bob, Dave, Fran, and Jack. For example,
 • Alice is friends with Bob, Dave, Fran, and Jack.
 • Bob is friends with Alice, Dave, Fran, and Jack.
 • Dave is friends with Alice, Bob, Fran, and Jack.
 • Fran is friends with Alice, Bob, Dave, and Jack.
 • Jack is friends with Alice, Bob, Dave, and Fran.
Since every two people in this set of five are friends with each other, they must all wear different colors. That already requires 5 different colors. But the entire group of 10 (outside of Irene and Larry) only has 4 colors available (recall, they cannot use the two colors worn by Irene and Larry).

Because a clique of 5 within these 10 vertices forces a need for 5 distinct colors and because Irene and Larry “steal” two of the six available colors (since every other person is adjacent to them and so cannot share their colors), there is no way to assign the six colors so that no two friends wear the same one.

We will show that no matter how the six shirt‐colors (red, green, blue, yellow, orange, purple) are distributed, some pair of friends must end up with the same color.

A careful look at the friendship list reveals that two people— #8 and #11—are “universal”: each is friends with every one of the other 11 people. (For example, #8 is listed as friends with #0, #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7, #9, #10, and #11, and similarly #11 is friends with everyone else.) Because #8 is friends with every other person, no one else at the party may wear the same shirt‐color as #8; and similarly no one else may wear #11’s shirt color. Thus, if we had six colors in total, the remaining 10 people (everyone except #8 and #11) would be forced to choose their colors from only the 4 colors not used by #8 and #11.

However, one may check that among these 10 people the following five form a clique (i.e. every one of them is friends with every other one in the group): #0, #1, #3, #5, and #9. For example,
 • #0 is friends with #1, #3, #5, and #9.
 • #1 is friends with #0, #3, #5, and #9.
 • #3 is friends with #0, #1, #5, and #9.
 • #5 is friends with #0, #1, #3, and #9.
 • #9 is friends with #0, #1, #3, and #5.
