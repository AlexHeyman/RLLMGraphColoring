After analyzing the friendships, we see that there is a set of seven people—Carol, Fran, George, Heather, Jack, Kathy, and Larry—such that every two among them are friends. In graph theory terms, these seven people form a clique (a complete subgraph K₇). Since a clique of size n requires n different colors (or shirt colors, in this context) to ensure no two adjacent vertices receive the same color, this clique forces us to need at least 7 colors. However, only 6 colors are available.
