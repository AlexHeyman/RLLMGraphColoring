We will show that no assignment of six different shirt‐colors (red, green, blue, yellow, orange, and purple) to the 12 people can avoid a “color–conflict” (that is, some pair of friends ending up with the same color).

More precisely, if one writes down all the friendship relations as an undirected graph (with one vertex per person and an edge joining two people if they are friends), one finds that among the 12 vertices one may “spot” a clique of size 6. (For example, one may verify that
  Alice, Dave, Ethan, Heather, Jack, and Larry
are all mutual friends.) This shows that at least six different colors are needed to “color” the graph. (By the “graph‐coloring” formulation, no proper coloring is possible with fewer than six colors.) One might hope that six colors in total would suffice. However, no matter how one tries to assign six different colors to the people so that each friend–pair gets different colors, one finds an unavoidable “bottleneck:” there is always some person (for example, one may check the neighbors of Irene or of Larry) whose set of (already–used) neighbor–colors forces all six colors to appear and leaves no color available.

Any attempted 6–coloring runs into a conflict. (One natural idea is to “force” the six colors onto the six people in the 6–clique, but then one of the vertices outside that clique – say, Irene, who is friends with five of the clique–members plus some others – is “surrounded” by all six colors.) One may try many different assignments (and one may even try a systematic back–tracking procedure), yet one always finds that some vertex ends up with all six colors already present among its friends, so that no available color remains.

Because every one of the many “candidate assignments” fails, there is no way to have all 12 people wear shirts (from the six available colors) so that no two friends wear the same color.

Thus, under the conditions given the answer is:

Impossible
