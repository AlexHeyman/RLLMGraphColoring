Evaluation: impossible incorrect

We can show that no valid assignment exists.

Note that the requirements amount to “properly coloring” a graph whose vertices are the 12 people and whose edges connect friends. (Two friends must get different colors.)

There are 6 colors available: red, green, blue, yellow, orange, and purple.

Among the 12 people, look at the following friendships:
 • Alice is friends with Bob, Carol, Fran, George, Heather, and Larry.
 • In addition, Bob, Carol, Fran, George, Heather, and Larry are all friends with one another (for example, Bob is friends with Carol, Fran, George, Heather, and Larry; Carol is friends with Bob, Fran, George, Heather, and Larry; and so on).

This means that the set {Alice, Bob, Carol, Fran, George, Heather, Larry} forms a clique of 7 vertices (a clique is a set where every pair of vertices is connected by an edge). In any proper coloring, the 7 vertices of a clique must receive 7 different colors. (Even if we were just forced to color the clique {Bob, Carol, Fran, George, Heather, Larry} with 6 colors because they are completely mutually adjacent, Alice—who is adjacent to all of them—would still have no available color to choose from.)

Since only 6 colors are available but a clique of size 7 requires 7 distinct colors, it is impossible to assign colors (shirts) to all 12 people in a way that no two friends share the same color.
