We begin by describing the “friendship‐graph” among the 12 people. (All friendships are mutual.) For example, the list tells us that Kathy is friends with Alice, Bob, Carol, Ethan, George, Heather, Irene, Jack, and Larry. In particular, notice the following seven people:

  Kathy, Carol, Ethan, Heather, Irene, Jack, and Larry.

Carefully checking the list shows that:
 • Carol is friends with Ethan, Heather, Irene, Jack, and Larry.
 • Ethan is friends with Carol, Heather, Irene, Jack, and Larry.
 • Heather is friends with Carol, Ethan, Irene, Jack, and Larry.
 • Irene is friends with Carol, Ethan, Heather, Jack, and Larry.
 • Jack is friends with Carol, Ethan, Heather, Irene, and Larry.
 • Larry is friends with Carol, Ethan, Heather, Irene, and Jack.
Also, Kathy is explicitly stated to be friends with each of Carol, Ethan, Heather, Irene, Jack, and Larry.

Thus these 7 people form a complete subgraph (a clique of size 7). In any proper coloring the vertices of a clique must all receive different colors. That is, these 7 people would need 7 different shirt colors. Since only 6 colors (red, green, blue, yellow, orange, purple) are available, there’s no way to assign colors so that no two friends wear the same colored shirt.

We begin by describing the “friendship‐graph” among the 12 people. (All friendships are mutual.) For example, the list tells us that #10 is friends with #0, #1, #2, #4, #6, #7, #8, #9, and #11. In particular, notice the following seven people:

  #10, #2, #4, #7, #8, #9, and #11.

Carefully checking the list shows that:
 • #2 is friends with #4, #7, #8, #9, and #11.
 • #4 is friends with #2, #7, #8, #9, and #11.
 • #7 is friends with #2, #4, #8, #9, and #11.
 • #8 is friends with #2, #4, #7, #9, and #11.
 • #9 is friends with #2, #4, #7, #8, and #11.
 • #11 is friends with #2, #4, #7, #8, and #9.
Also, #10 is explicitly stated to be friends with each of #2, #4, #7, #8, #9, and #11.
