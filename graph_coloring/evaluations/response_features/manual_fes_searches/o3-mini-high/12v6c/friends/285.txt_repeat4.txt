We begin by modeling the situation as a graph where each person is a vertex and an edge connects two people if they are friends. To ensure that no pair of friends wears the same color shirt, we must assign a color (from the 6 available) to each vertex so that adjacent vertices have different colors. In other words, we need a proper graph coloring with 6 colors.

A key observation in graph coloring is that if the graph contains a clique (a set of vertices all mutually adjacent) of size k, then at least k different colors are needed—one for each vertex in the clique.

Let’s look at the following set of 7 people:
  Carol, Fran, George, Heather, Jack, Kathy, Larry

Checking the friendship list:
• Carol is friends with Fran, George, Heather, Jack, Kathy, and Larry.
• Fran is friends with Carol, George, Heather, Jack, Kathy, and Larry.
• George is friends with Carol, Fran, Heather, Jack, Kathy, and Larry.
• Heather is friends with Carol, Fran, George, Jack, Kathy, and Larry.
• Jack is friends with Carol, Fran, Heather, Kathy, Larry, and (by symmetry, since George is friends with Jack) George.
• Kathy is friends with Carol, Fran, George, Heather, Jack, and Larry.
• Larry is friends with Carol, Fran, George, Heather, Jack, and Kathy.

Thus every pair among these 7 is friends—that is, they form a clique of size 7. This requires that each of these 7 people wears a different color shirt.

Since we only have 6 colors available, it is impossible to assign the colors without having at least two friends (within this clique) share the same color.

Let’s look at the following set of 7 people:
  #2, #5, #6, #7, #9, #10, #11

Checking the friendship list:
• #2 is friends with #5, #6, #7, #9, #10, and #11.
• #5 is friends with #2, #6, #7, #9, #10, and #11.
• #6 is friends with #2, #5, #7, #9, #10, and #11.
• #7 is friends with #2, #5, #6, #9, #10, and #11.
• #9 is friends with #2, #5, #7, #10, #11, and (by symmetry, since #6 is friends with #9) #6.
• #10 is friends with #2, #5, #6, #7, #9, and #11.
• #11 is friends with #2, #5, #6, #7, #9, and #10.

Thus every pair among these 7 is friends—that is, they form a clique of size 7. This requires that each of these 7 people wears a different color shirt.
