We can model the situation as a graph whose vertices are the 12 people and whose edges connect two people if they’re friends. Then “no two friends wear the same color” means we need a proper vertex‑coloring of the graph using the six colors (red, green, blue, yellow, orange, and purple).

A key observation is that if any vertex is adjacent to a set of six people who are mutually friends (a clique of size 6), then those six neighbors must all get different colors. That would force all six colors among the neighbors. Then the vertex itself—being adjacent to all six colors—would have no available color from our six‐color palette.

Let’s see that in our graph. The friendships given include, for example:

• Alice is friends with Bob, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, Jack, Kathy, and Larry.
• Bob is friends with Dave, Ethan, Fran, Heather, Irene, Jack, Kathy, and Larry.
• Dave is friends with Ethan, Fran, George, Heather, Irene, Kathy, and Larry.
• Ethan is friends with Fran, George, Jack, Kathy, and Larry.
• Fran is friends with George, Heather, Irene, Jack, and Larry.
• Kathy is friends with Larry (among others).

In particular, observe that the six people
  Bob, Dave, Ethan, Fran, Kathy, and Larry
form a clique. (One can check that every two among these six are recorded as friends.) Since they are all friends with one another, any proper coloring must give all six a different color.

Now look at Alice. Her friend list is:
  Bob, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, Jack, Kathy, Larry.
In her list are the six clique members (Bob, Dave, Ethan, Fran, Kathy, Larry). In any proper 6‑coloring these six neighbors get all six different colors. That leaves no color available for Alice because whichever color you choose for her, one of her friends already has it.

Since this problem appears in every proper assignment of the six colors the neighbor clique “uses up” all the available colors, there is no way to choose a color for Alice without conflicting with one of her friends.

Thus, with only the six colors available, it is impossible to assign a shirt color to every person so that no pair of friends wears the same color.
