We will show that no assignment of the six available colors can prevent two friends from wearing the same color. In fact, a little inspection of the friendship network shows that there is a group of seven people who are all mutual friends. (Recall that if a graph has a clique of size k then it requires at least k colors to color it so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.)

One such clique is:
  Bob, Ethan, George, Jack, Kathy, Larry, and Heather.

To explain briefly:
• Bob, Ethan, George, Jack, Kathy, and Larry form a complete subgraph (each is friends with every other in that list).
• In addition, Heather is friends with each of Bob, Ethan, George, Jack, Kathy, and Larry.
Thus, these seven people are all mutually connected. They would have to receive seven different colors.
Since only six colors (red, green, blue, yellow, orange, and purple) are available, it is impossible to assign colors so that every pair of friends has a different color.

(Recall that if a graph has a clique of size k then it requires at least k colors to color it so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.)

One such clique is:
  #1, #4, #6, #9, #10, #11, and #7.

To explain briefly:
• #1, #4, #6, #9, #10, and #11 form a complete subgraph (each is friends with every other in that list).
• In addition, #7 is friends with each of #1, #4, #6, #9, #10, and #11.
