There is no valid assignment. In fact, notice that Kathy is friends with everyone else, and the six people {Alice, Carol, Ethan, Fran, Heather, Larry} form a clique (each of these six is friends with every other among them). Adding Kathy (who is friends with all) gives a clique of 7 people. Any clique of size 7 must receive 7 distinct colors, but only 6 colors are available.
