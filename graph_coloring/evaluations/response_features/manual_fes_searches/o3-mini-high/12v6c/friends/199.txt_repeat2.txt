Let’s view the situation as a graph‐coloring problem. Each person is a vertex, and an edge connects two people if they are friends. We have 6 available colors. Notice that Larry is friends with everyone else, so Larry’s color can’t be used by any other vertex. That leaves the remaining 11 vertices to be colored using the other 5 colors.

Now, if even one set of vertices among those 11 requires 6 different colors (that is, if there is a clique of size 6), then the whole graph cannot be colored with 6 colors in total (since Larry’s color is “blocked” for all his neighbors).

A careful look at the friendships reveals that the following vertices all know each other:
  Carol, Dave, Fran, George, Heather, and Kathy.
Each is friends with every other in that set. (For example, Carol is friends with Dave, Fran, George, Heather, and Kathy; Dave is friends with Carol, Fran, George, Heather, and Kathy; and so on.) This means they form a clique of size 6. Now add Larry (who is friends with everyone) to this clique, and we obtain a clique of size 7.

Since a clique of size 7 must be assigned 7 distinct colors and we only have 6 available, it is impossible to assign shirt colors so that no two friends share the same color.

Let’s view the situation as a graph‐coloring problem. Each person is a vertex, and an edge connects two people if they are friends. We have 6 available colors. Notice that #11 is friends with everyone else, so #11’s color can’t be used by any other vertex. That leaves the remaining 11 vertices to be colored using the other 5 colors.

Now, if even one set of vertices among those 11 requires 6 different colors (that is, if there is a clique of size 6), then the whole graph cannot be colored with 6 colors in total (since #11’s color is “blocked” for all his neighbors).

A careful look at the friendships reveals that the following vertices all know each other:
  #2, #3, #5, #6, #7, and #10.
Each is friends with every other in that set. (For example, #2 is friends with #3, #5, #6, #7, and #10; #3 is friends with #2, #5, #6, #7, and #10; and so on.) This means they form a clique of size 6. Now add #11 (who is friends with everyone) to this clique, and we obtain a clique of size 7.

Since a clique of size 7 must be assigned 7 distinct colors and we only have 6 available, it is impossible to assign shirt colors so that no two friends share the same color.
