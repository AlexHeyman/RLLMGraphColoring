We will show that no matter how the 12 people choose among the six shirt colors, there is a set of people all of whom are mutual friends that would force seven different colors. In other words, the “friendship‐graph” contains a clique (a set of vertices all pairwise adjacent) of size 7, while only 6 colors are available.

To explain briefly, label the people as follows:
 Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather, Irene, Jack, Kathy, Larry.
A careful look at the friendship relations reveals that the following 7 people are all mutual friends:
 Ethan, Fran, George, Irene, Kathy, Larry, and Jack.

For example:
 – Ethan is friends with Fran, George, Irene, Jack, Kathy, and Larry.
 – Fran is friends with Ethan, George, Irene, Jack, Kathy, and Larry.
 – Jack is friends with Ethan, Fran, George, Irene, Kathy, and Larry.
(and one may check that every pair among these 7 are indeed connected by a friendship.)

Because these 7 people all know one another, in any proper coloring (i.e. a choice of shirt colors so that no two friends share the same color) they must receive 7 different colors. But there are only 6 colors available (red, green, blue, yellow, orange, and purple).

Therefore, it is impossible to assign a shirt color to each person so that no two friends wear the same color.
