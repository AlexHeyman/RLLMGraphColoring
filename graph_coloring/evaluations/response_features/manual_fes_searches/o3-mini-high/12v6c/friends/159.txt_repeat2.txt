We first interpret the situation as a graph‐coloring problem. Each person is a vertex, and an edge connects any two people who are friends. The rule is that adjacent vertices (friends) cannot be given the same color. We have 6 colors available: red, green, blue, yellow, orange, and purple.

For a proper coloring to be possible, the graph’s chromatic number must be at most 6. However, if the graph contains a clique (a set of vertices all mutually adjacent) of size 7 or larger, at least 7 different colors would be needed—one for each member of the clique. (Remember that in any clique every pair of vertices is connected, so every member must have a unique color.)

Let’s look at a specific subset of people:
  • Alice is friends with Dave, Ethan, Heather, Jack, Kathy, and Larry.
  • Dave is friends with Ethan, Heather, Jack, Kathy, and Larry.
  • Ethan is friends with Heather, Jack, Kathy, and Larry.
  • Heather is friends with Jack, Kathy, and Larry.
  • Jack is friends with Kathy and Larry.
  • Kathy is friends with Larry.

Every pair of these 7 (Alice, Dave, Ethan, Heather, Jack, Kathy, Larry) is friends:
  – Alice is friends with all of Dave, Ethan, Heather, Jack, Kathy, and Larry.
  – And among the other six, every listed friendship appears.
For example, Dave is friends with Ethan, Heather, Jack, Kathy, and Larry; Ethan is friends with Heather, Jack, Kathy, and Larry; and so on.

Thus, {Alice, Dave, Ethan, Heather, Jack, Kathy, Larry} forms a clique of size 7. This means that no matter what, if we attempted a proper coloring, these 7 people would each require a different color.

Since only 6 colors are available, it is impossible to assign colors so that no two friends share the same color.
