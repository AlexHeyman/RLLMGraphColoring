Evaluation: impossible incorrect

We only have 6 colors available (red, green, blue, yellow, orange, purple). But note that the people Bob, Carol, Ethan, Heather, Irene, and Jack all are mutual friends (each pair among them are friends). In any proper coloring, every two people who are friends must have different colors—so this 6‐person clique must use all 6 colors with no repeats.

Now, observe that Alice is friends with Bob, Carol, Ethan, Heather, Irene, and Jack (among others). This means that all 6 colors are already “in use” among her friends. With only 6 colors available, there is no remaining color for Alice, a contradiction.

Thus, there is no way to assign each of the 12 people a color from the 6 choices without two friends sharing the same color.

In any proper coloring, every two people who are friends must have different colors—so this 6‐person clique must use all 6 colors with no repeats.

Now, observe that #0 is friends with #1, #2, #4, #7, #8, and #9 (among others). This means that all 6 colors are already “in use” among her friends. With only 6 colors available, there is no remaining color for #0, a contradiction.

Thus, there is no way to assign each of the 12 people a color from the 6 choices without two friends sharing the same color.
