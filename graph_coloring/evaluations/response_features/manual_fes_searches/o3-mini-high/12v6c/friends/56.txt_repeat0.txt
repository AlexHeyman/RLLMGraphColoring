We can view the problem as one of graph coloring. Represent each person as a vertex and each friendship as an edge between vertices; the task is then to assign one of the six colors (red, green, blue, yellow, orange, purple) to each vertex so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.

A key observation is to determine the graph’s clique number—a clique is a set of vertices all of which are pairwise adjacent. In a proper coloring, each vertex of a clique must receive a different color. Therefore, if the graph contains a clique of size k, then at least k colors are needed.

Looking at the given friendships, notice that Fran is friends with everyone except herself. In fact, you can identify a clique of size 7 by taking the vertices {Fran, Bob, Carol, Ethan, Irene, Jack, Larry}. Checking these:
 • Fran is friends with each of Bob, Carol, Ethan, Irene, Jack, and Larry.
 • Every pair among Bob, Carol, Ethan, Irene, Jack, and Larry are also friends with each other (for example, Bob is friends with Carol, Ethan, Irene, Jack, and Larry; Carol is friends with Ethan, Irene, Jack, and Larry; and so on).

Since these 7 people form a clique, they would all need to wear different colors. However, there are only 6 colors available.

Thus, it is impossible to assign the colors without violating the friendship rule.

Looking at the given friendships, notice that #5 is friends with everyone except herself. In fact, you can identify a clique of size 7 by taking the vertices {#5, #1, #2, #4, #8, #9, #11}. Checking these:
 • #5 is friends with each of #1, #2, #4, #8, #9, and #11.
 • Every pair among #1, #2, #4, #8, #9, and #11 are also friends with each other (for example, #1 is friends with #2, #4, #8, #9, and #11; #2 is friends with #4, #8, #9, and #11; and so on).
