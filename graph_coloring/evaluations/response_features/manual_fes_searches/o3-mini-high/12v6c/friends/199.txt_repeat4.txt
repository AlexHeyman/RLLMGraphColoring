We can model the situation as a graph whose vertices are the 12 people and where an edge connects two people if they are friends. (Friendship here is assumed to be a symmetric relation.) Our goal is to assign one of 6 shirt colors (red, green, blue, yellow, orange, purple) to each person so that no two adjacent (“friends‐”) vertices share the same color—in other words, to “properly color” the graph using 6 colors.

A fundamental fact from graph theory is that if the graph contains a clique (a set of vertices all pairwise connected) of size k, then at least k different colors are needed (since every pair of vertices in that clique must receive different colors). In our situation, if we can find a clique of 7 people the graph would have a chromatic number (minimum number of colors needed) of at least 7. This would make a 6‐coloring impossible.

A look at the list of friendships shows that Larry is friends with everyone else. Thus Larry is a “universal” vertex. Now, if even a set of 6 people among the other 11 are all mutually friends, then when Larry (who is adjacent to every one of them) is added the resulting clique would have size 7.

In fact, one may verify that the people 
  Dave, Fran, George, Heather, Jack, and Kathy 
form a clique. For example:
 • Dave is friends with Fran, George, Heather, Jack, and Kathy.
 • Fran is friends with Dave, George, Heather, Jack, and Kathy.
 • George is friends with Dave, Fran, Heather, Jack, and Kathy.
 • Heather is friends with Dave, Fran, George, Jack, and Kathy.
 • Jack is friends with Dave, Fran, George, Heather, and Kathy.
 • Kathy is friends with Dave, Fran, George, Heather, and Jack.

Since all six are mutually connected, they form a clique of size 6. But because Larry is friends with everyone, adding Larry to this set produces a clique of 7.

A clique of 7 means that at least 7 different colors would be needed so that no two people in that clique wear the same color. Since we only have 6 colors available, it is impossible to assign the colors as desired.

A look at the list of friendships shows that #11 is friends with everyone else. Thus #11 is a “universal” vertex. Now, if even a set of 6 people among the other 11 are all mutually friends, then when #11 (who is adjacent to every one of them) is added the resulting clique would have size 7.

In fact, one may verify that the people 
  #3, #5, #6, #7, #9, and #10 
form a clique. For example:
 • #3 is friends with #5, #6, #7, #9, and #10.
 • #5 is friends with #3, #6, #7, #9, and #10.
 • #6 is friends with #3, #5, #7, #9, and #10.
 • #7 is friends with #3, #5, #6, #9, and #10.
 • #9 is friends with #3, #5, #6, #7, and #10.
 • #10 is friends with #3, #5, #6, #7, and #9.

Since all six are mutually connected, they form a clique of size 6. But because #11 is friends with everyone, adding #11 to this set produces a clique of 7.
