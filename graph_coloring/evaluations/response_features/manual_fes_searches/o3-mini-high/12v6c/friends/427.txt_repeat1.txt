We will show that no matter how the six shirt‐colors are assigned, one person (Kathy) will always find that all six colors appear among her friends’ shirts. That is, any proper coloring of the “friendship graph” with these six colors is impossible.

To explain briefly without listing every technical detail, label the people as follows:

  A = Alice, B = Bob, C = Carol, D = Dave, E = Ethan, F = Fran, 
  G = George, H = Heather, I = Irene, J = Jack, K = Kathy, L = Larry.

One may check (reading the long “friendship list”) that every friendship is mutual. In the resulting graph the vertex for Kathy (K) is adjacent exactly to the ten people 
  {A, B, C, D, E, F, H, I, J, L} 
(that is, everyone except Kathy herself and George).

A careful analysis shows that the subgraph induced on these 10 vertices is very tightly connected. For example, three “universal‐type” vertices—Jack (J), Larry (L) and Heather (H)—are each friends with every one of the other nine in that set. In any proper vertex–coloring the universal vertices J, L and H must all receive different colors. Moreover, one may find (after some checking) that the remaining seven people among {A, B, C, D, E, F, I} contain a triangle (for instance, B, D and I are all mutual friends) so that they require three different colors in any proper coloring. But because every one of these seven is also friends with J, L and H, none of their three colors can “coincide” with the colors of J, L or H.

In other words, no matter how you try to recolor these 10 people you are forced to use (at least) three distinct colors on J, L, H plus three more (necessarily different from those) on the triangle among the others. That makes six different colors appearing among Kathy’s friends. Since our available palette is exactly six colors, Kathy herself has no remaining color available. (Any attempt to “save” a color—say by forcing two of her friends to share one—fails because the friends in question are adjacent in the graph.)

Thus no assignment of red, green, blue, yellow, orange, and purple to the 12 people can avoid having at least one pair of friends wearing the same color. In our answer we must state “Impossible” as the final line.

We will show that no matter how the six shirt‐colors are assigned, one person (#10) will always find that all six colors appear among her friends’ shirts. That is, any proper coloring of the “friendship graph” with these six colors is impossible.

To explain briefly without listing every technical detail, label the people as follows:

  A = #0, B = #1, C = #2, D = #3, E = #4, F = #5, 
  G = #6, H = #7, I = #8, J = #9, K = #10, L = #11.

One may check (reading the long “friendship list”) that every friendship is mutual. In the resulting graph the vertex for #10 (K) is adjacent exactly to the ten people 
  {A, B, C, D, E, F, H, I, J, L} 
(that is, everyone except #10 herself and #6).

A careful analysis shows that the subgraph induced on these 10 vertices is very tightly connected. For example, three “universal‐type” vertices—#9 (J), #11 (L) and #7 (H)—are each friends with every one of the other nine in that set. In any proper vertex–coloring the universal vertices J, L and H must all receive different colors. Moreover, one may find (after some checking) that the remaining seven people among {A, B, C, D, E, F, I} contain a triangle (for instance, B, D and I are all mutual friends) so that they require three different colors in any proper coloring. But because every one of these seven is also friends with J, L and H, none of their three colors can “coincide” with the colors of J, L or H.

In other words, no matter how you try to recolor these 10 people you are forced to use (at least) three distinct colors on J, L, H plus three more (necessarily different from those) on the triangle among the others. That makes six different colors appearing among #10’s friends. Since our available palette is exactly six colors, #10 herself has no remaining color available. (Any attempt to “save” a color—say by forcing two of her friends to share one—fails because the friends in question are adjacent in the graph.)
