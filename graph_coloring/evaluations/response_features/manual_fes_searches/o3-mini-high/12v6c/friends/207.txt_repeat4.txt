We will show that no assignment of the six shirt‐colors (red, green, blue, yellow, orange, purple) to the 12 people can guarantee that no pair of friends ends up in the same color.

Below is one way to see the impossibility.

Step 1. Notice that two of the people, Irene and Larry, are “universal” in the sense that each is friends with everyone else. In our list, Irene is friends with Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather, Jack, Kathy, and Larry, and Larry is friends with everyone except himself. (In other words, both Irene and Larry have 11 friends.) Since friends must wear different colors, Irene and Larry must have different shirt colors.

Step 2. Because every other person is friends with both Irene and Larry (the lists for every other vertex include Irene and Larry), none of the remaining 10 people may use the same shirt‐color as Irene or Larry. With six available colors and two “used up” by Irene and Larry, only 4 colors remain for the other 10 people.

Step 3. Now look at the induced friendship relations among the remaining 10 people (those besides Irene and Larry). A short check (see “Getting our hands dirty” below) shows that the five people
  Alice, Bob, Dave, Heather, and Jack
form a clique in the induced graph. That is, each pair among these five are friends. (For example, from the lists we have:
  • Alice is friends with Bob, Dave, Heather, and Jack.
  • Bob is friends with Alice, Dave, Heather, and Jack.
  • Dave is friends with Alice, Bob, Heather, and Jack.
  • Heather is friends with Alice, Bob, Dave, and Jack.
  • Jack is friends with Alice, Bob, Dave, and Heather.)
A clique of 5 requires that all five receive different colors.

Step 4. But the 10 people (all friends with Irene and Larry) may only use 4 colors (because they cannot use the two colors chosen for Irene and Larry). Since a 5‐clique can’t be colored with only 4 colors, no valid assignment exists.

Thus, it is impossible.

Impossible

We will show that no assignment of the six shirt‐colors (red, green, blue, yellow, orange, purple) to the 12 people can guarantee that no pair of friends ends up in the same color.

Below is one way to see the impossibility.

Step 1. Notice that two of the people, #8 and #11, are “universal” in the sense that each is friends with everyone else. In our list, #8 is friends with #0, #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7, #9, #10, and #11, and #11 is friends with everyone except himself. (In other words, both #8 and #11 have 11 friends.) Since friends must wear different colors, #8 and #11 must have different shirt colors.

Step 2. Because every other person is friends with both #8 and #11 (the lists for every other vertex include #8 and #11), none of the remaining 10 people may use the same shirt‐color as #8 or #11. With six available colors and two “used up” by #8 and #11, only 4 colors remain for the other 10 people.

Step 3. Now look at the induced friendship relations among the remaining 10 people (those besides #8 and #11). A short check (see “Getting our hands dirty” below) shows that the five people
  #0, #1, #3, #7, and #9
form a clique in the induced graph. That is, each pair among these five are friends. (For example, from the lists we have:
  • #0 is friends with #1, #3, #7, and #9.
  • #1 is friends with #0, #3, #7, and #9.
  • #3 is friends with #0, #1, #7, and #9.
  • #7 is friends with #0, #1, #3, and #9.
  • #9 is friends with #0, #1, #3, and #7.)
A clique of 5 requires that all five receive different colors.

Step 4. But the 10 people (all friends with #8 and #11) may only use 4 colors (because they cannot use the two colors chosen for #8 and #11). Since a 5‐clique can’t be colored with only 4 colors, no valid assignment exists.

Thus, it is impossible.
