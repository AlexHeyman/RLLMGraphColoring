We first model the situation as a graph where each person is a vertex and an edge is drawn between two people if they are friends. Then the party‐shirt assignment becomes a graph coloring problem: Can we assign one of the six available colors (red, green, blue, yellow, orange, purple) to each vertex such that adjacent vertices (i.e. friends) receive different colors?

Notice the following grouping:
 • Bob is friends with Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather, Irene, Jack, Kathy, and Larry.
 • Carol is friends with Bob, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather, Irene, Jack, Kathy, and Larry.
 • Dave is friends with Alice, Bob, Carol, Ethan, Fran, George, Irene, and Kathy.
 • Ethan is friends with Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Fran, George, Heather, Irene, and Larry.
 • Fran is friends with Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, George, Irene, Jack, and Kathy.
 • George is friends with Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, Irene, Jack, and Kathy.
 • Irene is friends with Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, Kathy, and Larry.

Look at the seven people: Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, and Irene. Check that every pair among these seven are friends (for example, Bob is friends with Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, and Irene; Carol is friends with Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, and Irene; and so on). In other words, these seven vertices form a complete subgraph (a clique of size 7).

Since in any clique every vertex must receive a different color, a clique of 7 requires at least 7 different colors. With only six colors available, there is no way to color the graph so that friends wear different colors.
