Evaluation: impossible incorrect

We can show that no valid assignment exists. In any proper coloring the people in any clique must receive all different colors, and it turns out that seven of the people are all mutual friends. For example, consider the group

  Alice, Dave, Fran, Irene, Jack, Kathy, Larry.

Checking the friendships:
• Alice is friends with Dave, Fran, Irene, Jack, Kathy, and Larry.
• Dave is friends with Fran, Irene, Jack, Kathy, and Larry.
• Fran is friends with Irene, Jack, Kathy, and Larry.
• Irene is friends with Jack, Kathy, and Larry.
• Jack is friends with Kathy and Larry.
• Kathy is friends with Larry.

Thus every pair within this seven‐person group is friends. In any party assignment the seven people would need to wear seven different colors, but only six colors (red, green, blue, yellow, orange, and purple) are available.

Therefore, it is impossible.

Impossible
