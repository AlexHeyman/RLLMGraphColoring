We will show that no matter how the 12 people choose shirts from the 6 available colors, there will always be two friends who end up with the same color.

Let’s view the situation as a graph where each person is a vertex and an edge connects two people if they are friends. The requirement is to assign one of 6 colors (red, green, blue, yellow, orange, purple) to each vertex so that adjacent vertices get different colors.

Notice in the given list that Larry is friends with everyone else. That forces Larry’s shirt color to be unique (no other vertex may share that color). Thus, the other 11 people would be forced to choose from the 5 remaining colors. In other words, if a 6‐coloring for the whole graph existed, then the subgraph induced by the other 11 vertices would have to be properly colored using only 5 colors.

However, if you examine the friendships among the other 11 people you will find a clique (a set of mutually adjacent vertices) of size 6. For example, consider the six people:
  Alice, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, and Kathy.
Checking all the pairs:
 • Alice is friends with Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, and Kathy.
 • Dave is friends with Alice, Ethan, Fran, George, and Kathy.
 • Ethan is friends with Alice, Dave, Fran, George, and Kathy.
 • Fran is friends with Alice, Dave, Ethan, George, and Kathy.
 • George is friends with Alice, Dave, Ethan, Fran, and Kathy.
 • Kathy is friends with Alice, Dave, Ethan, Fran, and George.
Thus these six form a complete subgraph (a clique of size 6). In any proper coloring a clique of size 6 must receive 6 distinct colors.

But now add Larry (who is friends with everyone) to this clique. The set {Larry, Alice, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, Kathy} forms a clique of size 7 because Larry is adjacent to all of the others. This means the whole graph has a clique of size 7 and therefore needs at least 7 colors for a proper coloring. Since only 6 colors are available, it is impossible to assign shirt colors to everyone without at least one pair of friends matching.

We will show that no matter how the 12 people choose shirts from the 6 available colors, there will always be two friends who end up with the same color.

Let’s view the situation as a graph where each person is a vertex and an edge connects two people if they are friends. The requirement is to assign one of 6 colors (red, green, blue, yellow, orange, purple) to each vertex so that adjacent vertices get different colors.

Notice in the given list that #11 is friends with everyone else. That forces #11’s shirt color to be unique (no other vertex may share that color). Thus, the other 11 people would be forced to choose from the 5 remaining colors. In other words, if a 6‐coloring for the whole graph existed, then the subgraph induced by the other 11 vertices would have to be properly colored using only 5 colors.

However, if you examine the friendships among the other 11 people you will find a clique (a set of mutually adjacent vertices) of size 6. For example, consider the six people:
  #0, #3, #4, #5, #6, and #10.
Checking all the pairs:
 • #0 is friends with #3, #4, #5, #6, and #10.
 • #3 is friends with #0, #4, #5, #6, and #10.
 • #4 is friends with #0, #3, #5, #6, and #10.
 • #5 is friends with #0, #3, #4, #6, and #10.
 • #6 is friends with #0, #3, #4, #5, and #10.
 • #10 is friends with #0, #3, #4, #5, and #6.
Thus these six form a complete subgraph (a clique of size 6). In any proper coloring a clique of size 6 must receive 6 distinct colors.

But now add #11 (who is friends with everyone) to this clique. The set {#11, #0, #3, #4, #5, #6, #10} forms a clique of size 7 because #11 is adjacent to all of the others. This means the whole graph has a clique of size 7 and therefore needs at least 7 colors for a proper coloring. Since only 6 colors are available, it is impossible to assign shirt colors to everyone without at least one pair of friends matching.
