Let's represent the people as vertices in a graph and the friendships as edges between the vertices. The people are {Alice (A), Bob (B), Carol (C), Dave (D), Ethan (E), Fran (F), George (G), Heather (H)}. The available colors are {Red, Green, Blue, Yellow}. The condition is that no two connected vertices (friends) can have the same color. This is a graph coloring problem, and we need to determine if the graph can be colored with 4 colors.

The friendships define the edges:
*   A: B, D, E, F, G, H
*   B: A, C, E, G, H
*   C: B, D, E, F, G, H
*   D: A, C, E, F, G, H
*   E: A, B, C, D, G, H
*   F: A, C, D, G
*   G: A, B, C, D, E, F, H (Note: G must be friends with H because A, B, C, D, E are friends with both G and H)
*   H: A, B, C, D, E, G

We need to check if there's a group of people who are all friends with each other (a clique). The size of the largest clique determines the minimum number of colors needed.

Consider the group {Alice, Bob, Ethan, George, Heather}. Let's check if they are all friends with each other:
*   Alice is friends with Bob, Ethan, George, Heather. (Yes)
*   Bob is friends with Alice, Ethan, George, Heather. (Yes)
*   Ethan is friends with Alice, Bob, George, Heather. (Yes)
*   George is friends with Alice, Bob, Ethan, Heather. (Yes, G is friends with A, B, E, H)
*   Heather is friends with Alice, Bob, Ethan, George. (Yes, H is friends with A, B, E, G)

Since Alice, Bob, Ethan, George, and Heather are all friends with each other, they form a clique of size 5. This means that all 5 of them must wear different colored shirts. However, there are only 4 colors available (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow). Therefore, it is impossible to assign shirt colors such that no two friends wear the same color.

Let's represent the people as vertices in a graph and the friendships as edges between the vertices. The people are {#0 (A), #1 (B), #2 (C), #3 (D), #4 (E), #5 (F), #6 (G), #7 (H)}. The available colors are {Red, Green, Blue, Yellow}. The condition is that no two connected vertices (friends) can have the same color. This is a graph coloring problem, and we need to determine if the graph can be colored with 4 colors.

The friendships define the edges:
*   A: B, D, E, F, G, H
*   B: A, C, E, G, H
*   C: B, D, E, F, G, H
*   D: A, C, E, F, G, H
*   E: A, B, C, D, G, H
*   F: A, C, D, G
*   G: A, B, C, D, E, F, H (Note: G must be friends with H because A, B, C, D, E are friends with both G and H)
*   H: A, B, C, D, E, G

We need to check if there's a group of people who are all friends with each other (a clique). The size of the largest clique determines the minimum number of colors needed.

Consider the group {#0, #1, #4, #6, #7}. Let's check if they are all friends with each other:
*   #0 is friends with #1, #4, #6, #7. (Yes)
*   #1 is friends with #0, #4, #6, #7. (Yes)
*   #4 is friends with #0, #1, #6, #7. (Yes)
*   #6 is friends with #0, #1, #4, #7. (Yes, G is friends with A, B, E, H)
*   #7 is friends with #0, #1, #4, #6. (Yes, H is friends with A, B, E, G)

Since #0, #1, #4, #6, and #7 are all friends with each other, they form a clique of size 5. This means that all 5 of them must wear different colored shirts. However, there are only 4 colors available (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow). Therefore, it is impossible to assign shirt colors such that no two friends wear the same color.
