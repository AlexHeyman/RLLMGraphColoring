To determine if it is possible for the 8 people to wear shirts of 4 different colors such that no two friends wear the same color, we can model this problem using graph theory. Let the 8 people be the vertices of a graph, and let an edge connect two vertices if the corresponding people are friends. The problem is then equivalent to determining if this graph can be colored using 4 colors such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. This is known as the graph 4-coloring problem.

Let the set of people be V = {Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather}. Let's denote them by their first letters {A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H}.
The available colors are {Red, Green, Blue, Yellow}.

Let's list the friendships (edges) in the graph:
A is friends with B, C, D, E, F, G, H.
B is friends with A, E, F, G, H.
C is friends with A, E, G, H.
D is friends with A, E, F, G, H.
E is friends with A, B, C, D, G, H.
F is friends with A, B, D, G, H.
G is friends with A, B, C, D, E, F, H.
H is friends with A, B, C, D, E, F, G.

In graph coloring, a clique is a subset of vertices such that every two distinct vertices in the clique are adjacent (friends). If a graph contains a clique of size k (denoted as Kk), then at least k colors are required to color the graph, because each vertex in the clique must be assigned a different color. The chromatic number of the graph, χ(G), must be greater than or equal to the size of the largest clique, ω(G).

Let's examine the set of people {Alice, Bob, Ethan, George, Heather}, or {A, B, E, G, H}. We need to check if they form a clique of size 5 (K5).
1.  Alice's friends: {B, C, D, E, F, G, H}. Alice is friends with B, E, G, H.
2.  Bob's friends: {A, E, F, G, H}. Bob is friends with A, E, G, H.
3.  Ethan's friends: {A, B, C, D, G, H}. Ethan is friends with A, B, G, H.
4.  George's friends: {A, B, C, D, E, F, H}. George is friends with A, B, E, H.
5.  Heather's friends: {A, B, C, D, E, F, G}. Heather is friends with A, B, E, G.

All pairs of people within the set {A, B, E, G, H} are friends with each other. For example:
- A and B are friends.
- A and E are friends.
- A and G are friends.
- A and H are friends.
- B and E are friends.
- B and G are friends.
- B and H are friends.
- E and G are friends.
- E and H are friends.
- G and H are friends.

Since these 5 people are all friends with each other, they form a K5 clique in the friendship graph. To color the vertices of this clique such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color, we would need at least 5 distinct colors. Each of Alice, Bob, Ethan, George, and Heather must wear a different color shirt.

However, there are only 4 available colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow). Since the graph requires at least 5 colors (χ(G) ≥ 5) and we only have 4 colors, it is impossible to assign shirt colors according to the given condition.
