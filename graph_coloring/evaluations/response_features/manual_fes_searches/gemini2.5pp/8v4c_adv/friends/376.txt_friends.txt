Let the set of 8 people be V = {Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather}. We can represent the people and their friendships as a graph G = (V, E), where the vertices are the people and an edge exists between two vertices if the corresponding people are friends. We are given 4 colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow) and we want to assign a color to each person such that no two friends have the same color. This is equivalent to finding a proper 4-coloring of the graph G.

Let's list the vertices and their neighbors based on the given friendships:
A (Alice): {C, D, E, F, G, H}
B (Bob): {C, D, E, F, G, H}
C (Carol): {A, B, E, G, H}
D (Dave): {A, B, F, G, H}
E (Ethan): {A, B, C, F, G, H}
F (Fran): {A, B, D, E, G, H}
G (George): {A, B, C, D, E, F, H}
H (Heather): {A, B, C, D, E, F, G}

We observe that vertices G and H are friends with each other. Also, G and H are friends with all other 6 people {A, B, C, D, E, F}.

Let the four available colors be c1, c2, c3, c4.
Suppose there exists a valid assignment of colors to the 8 people. Let the color assigned to person P be Color(P).
Since G and H are friends, they must have different colors. Let Color(G) = k1 and Color(H) = k2, where k1 ≠ k2.
Now consider any person P from the set V' = {A, B, C, D, E, F}.
Since P is friends with G, Color(P) must be different from Color(G) = k1.
Since P is friends with H, Color(P) must be different from Color(H) = k2.
Therefore, for any person P in V', Color(P) must be chosen from the set of colors {c1, c2, c3, c4} \ {k1, k2}. This means that all people in V' must be colored using only the remaining two colors. Let these two colors be k3 and k4.

This implies that the subgraph G' induced by the vertices V' = {A, B, C, D, E, F} must be 2-colorable. A graph is 2-colorable if and only if it is bipartite. A graph is bipartite if and only if it contains no odd cycles.

Let's examine the friendships (edges) within the subgraph G' induced by V' = {A, B, C, D, E, F}:
A is friends with C, D, E, F. Edges: (A, C), (A, D), (A, E), (A, F).
B is friends with C, D, E, F. Edges: (B, C), (B, D), (B, E), (B, F).
C is friends with A, B, E. Edges: (C, A), (C, B), (C, E).
D is friends with A, B, F. Edges: (D, A), (D, B), (D, F).
E is friends with A, B, C, F. Edges: (E, A), (E, B), (E, C), (E, F).
F is friends with A, B, D, E. Edges: (F, A), (F, B), (F, D), (F, E).

Let's check for odd cycles in G'.
Consider the set of people {A, C, E}.
A is friends with C. (A, C) is an edge.
C is friends with E. (C, E) is an edge.
E is friends with A. (E, A) is an edge.
So, A, C, E form a triangle (a cycle of length 3). Since 3 is an odd number, the subgraph G' contains an odd cycle.

Since G' contains an odd cycle, it is not bipartite.
Therefore, G' is not 2-colorable.
This contradicts the requirement that the vertices in V' must be colored using only two colors.
Thus, our initial assumption that a valid 4-coloring exists must be false.

It is impossible to assign colors to the 8 people such that no two friends wear the same color shirt using only 4 colors.

Impossible

Let the set of 8 people be V = {#0, #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7}. We can represent the people and their friendships as a graph G = (V, E), where the vertices are the people and an edge exists between two vertices if the corresponding people are friends. We are given 4 colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow) and we want to assign a color to each person such that no two friends have the same color. This is equivalent to finding a proper 4-coloring of the graph G.

Let's list the vertices and their neighbors based on the given friendships:
A (#0): {C, D, E, F, G, H}
B (#1): {C, D, E, F, G, H}
C (#2): {A, B, E, G, H}
D (#3): {A, B, F, G, H}
E (#4): {A, B, C, F, G, H}
F (#5): {A, B, D, E, G, H}
G (#6): {A, B, C, D, E, F, H}
H (#7): {A, B, C, D, E, F, G}

We observe that vertices G and H are friends with each other. Also, G and H are friends with all other 6 people {A, B, C, D, E, F}.

Let the four available colors be c1, c2, c3, c4.
Suppose there exists a valid assignment of colors to the 8 people. Let the color assigned to person P be Color(P).
Since G and H are friends, they must have different colors. Let Color(G) = k1 and Color(H) = k2, where k1 ≠ k2.
Now consider any person P from the set V' = {A, B, C, D, E, F}.
Since P is friends with G, Color(P) must be different from Color(G) = k1.
Since P is friends with H, Color(P) must be different from Color(H) = k2.
Therefore, for any person P in V', Color(P) must be chosen from the set of colors {c1, c2, c3, c4} \ {k1, k2}. This means that all people in V' must be colored using only the remaining two colors. Let these two colors be k3 and k4.

This implies that the subgraph G' induced by the vertices V' = {A, B, C, D, E, F} must be 2-colorable. A graph is 2-colorable if and only if it is bipartite. A graph is bipartite if and only if it contains no odd cycles.

Let's examine the friendships (edges) within the subgraph G' induced by V' = {A, B, C, D, E, F}:
A is friends with C, D, E, F. Edges: (A, C), (A, D), (A, E), (A, F).
B is friends with C, D, E, F. Edges: (B, C), (B, D), (B, E), (B, F).
C is friends with A, B, E. Edges: (C, A), (C, B), (C, E).
D is friends with A, B, F. Edges: (D, A), (D, B), (D, F).
E is friends with A, B, C, F. Edges: (E, A), (E, B), (E, C), (E, F).
F is friends with A, B, D, E. Edges: (F, A), (F, B), (F, D), (F, E).

Let's check for odd cycles in G'.
Consider the set of people {A, C, E}.
A is friends with C. (A, C) is an edge.
C is friends with E. (C, E) is an edge.
E is friends with A. (E, A) is an edge.
So, A, C, E form a triangle (a cycle of length 3). Since 3 is an odd number, the subgraph G' contains an odd cycle.

Since G' contains an odd cycle, it is not bipartite.
Therefore, G' is not 2-colorable.
This contradicts the requirement that the vertices in V' must be colored using only two colors.
Thus, our initial assumption that a valid 4-coloring exists must be false.

It is impossible to assign colors to the 8 people such that no two friends wear the same color shirt using only 4 colors.
