Let the 8 people be represented by the vertices of a graph G = (V, E), where V = {Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather}. An edge exists between two vertices if the corresponding people are friends. The available shirt colors are Red, Green, Blue, Yellow (4 colors). The problem asks if we can assign a color to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. This is equivalent to asking if the graph G is 4-colorable.

The friendships define the edges of the graph G. Let's denote the people by their first letters: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H.
The friendships are:
A: {B, C, E, F, G}
B: {A, D, E, F, G, H}
C: {A, D, E, F, G, H}
D: {B, C, E, F, G, H}
E: {A, B, C, D, G, H}
F: {A, B, C, D, G, H}
G: {A, B, C, D, E, F, H}
H: {B, C, D, E, F, G}

In graph coloring, if a graph contains a clique of size k (a set of k vertices where every pair of vertices is connected by an edge), then at least k colors are needed for a proper coloring. We have 4 colors available. If we can find a clique of size 5 (a 5-clique), then it is impossible to color the graph with only 4 colors.

Let's examine the set of people {Bob, Dave, Ethan, George, Heather}, or {B, D, E, G, H}. We need to check if every pair in this set are friends.
- Bob's friends list: {A, D, E, F, G, H}. Bob is friends with D, E, G, H.
- Dave's friends list: {B, C, E, F, G, H}. Dave is friends with B, E, G, H.
- Ethan's friends list: {A, B, C, D, G, H}. Ethan is friends with B, D, G, H.
- George's friends list: {A, B, C, D, E, F, H}. George is friends with B, D, E, H.
- Heather's friends list: {B, C, D, E, F, G}. Heather is friends with B, D, E, G.

Let's check all pairs within {B, D, E, G, H}:
- (B, D): Yes, they are friends.
- (B, E): Yes, they are friends.
- (B, G): Yes, they are friends.
- (B, H): Yes, they are friends.
- (D, E): Yes, they are friends.
- (D, G): Yes, they are friends.
- (D, H): Yes, they are friends.
- (E, G): Yes, they are friends.
- (E, H): Yes, they are friends.
- (G, H): Yes, they are friends.

Since every pair of people in the set {Bob, Dave, Ethan, George, Heather} are friends with each other, this set forms a 5-clique in the friendship graph. To color the vertices of a 5-clique such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color, we need at least 5 distinct colors.

However, we only have 4 colors available (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow). Therefore, it is impossible to assign shirt colors to these 8 people according to the given condition (no two friends wear the same color shirt).
