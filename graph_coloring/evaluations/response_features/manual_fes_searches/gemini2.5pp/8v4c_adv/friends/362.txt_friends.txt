To determine if it is possible for the 8 people to wear shirts of 4 different colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow) such that no two friends wear the same color shirt, we can model this problem using graph coloring. Let the 8 people be the vertices of a graph G, and let an edge connect two vertices if the corresponding people are friends. We want to know if this graph G is 4-colorable.

The people are V = {Alice (A), Bob (B), Carol (C), Dave (D), Ethan (E), Fran (F), George (G), Heather (H)}.
The available colors are C = {Red, Green, Blue, Yellow}. The number of colors is k = 4.

Let's list the friendships (edges) based on the problem description:
A is friends with B, C, D, E, G, H.
B is friends with A, C, D, E, F.
C is friends with A, B, E, F, G, H.
D is friends with A, B, E, F, G, H.
E is friends with A, B, C, D, F, G, H.
F is friends with B, C, D, E, G, H.
G is friends with A, C, D, E, F, H.
H is friends with A, C, D, E, F, G.

In graph theory terms, two vertices connected by an edge must have different colors. A key property of graph coloring is that if a graph G contains a clique of size k (a set of k vertices where every pair of vertices is connected by an edge, denoted K_k), then the chromatic number of G, χ(G), must be at least k (χ(G) ≥ k). This is because all k vertices in the clique must be assigned different colors.

Let's examine the friendships among the subset of people {Carol, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather}. Let's denote this set as S = {C, E, F, G, H}.
We check the friendships between pairs of people in S:
- Carol (C) is friends with E, F, G, H. (From C's friend list: A, B, E, F, G, H)
- Ethan (E) is friends with C, F, G, H. (From E's friend list: A, B, C, D, F, G, H)
- Fran (F) is friends with C, E, G, H. (From F's friend list: B, C, D, E, G, H)
- George (G) is friends with C, E, F, H. (From G's friend list: A, C, D, E, F, H)
- Heather (H) is friends with C, E, F, G. (From H's friend list: A, C, D, E, F, G)

All pairs of people in the set S = {C, E, F, G, H} are friends with each other. This means that the subgraph induced by these 5 vertices is a complete graph K_5.

Since the graph G contains a K_5 clique (the vertices C, E, F, G, H), we need at least 5 different colors to color the graph G such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.
However, we only have 4 colors available (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow).
Therefore, it is impossible to assign colors to the 8 people according to the given constraints.
