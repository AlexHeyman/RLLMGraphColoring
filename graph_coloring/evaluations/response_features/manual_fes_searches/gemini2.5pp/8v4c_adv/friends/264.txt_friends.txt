To determine if it's possible for the 8 people to wear shirts of 4 different colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow) such that no two friends wear the same color shirt, we can model this problem using graph theory. Let the 8 people be the vertices of a graph, and let an edge connect two vertices if the corresponding people are friends. The problem is equivalent to asking if this graph can be colored using 4 colors such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. This is known as the graph 4-coloring problem.

Let the people be represented by their initials: A (Alice), B (Bob), C (Carol), D (Dave), E (Ethan), F (Fran), G (George), H (Heather).
The friendships define the edges of the graph G = (V, E), where V = {A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H}.
The friendships are:
A is friends with B, D, F, G, H.
B is friends with A, C, D, E, G, H.
C is friends with B, D, G, H.
D is friends with A, B, C, E, F, G, H.
E is friends with B, D, F, G, H.
F is friends with A, D, E, G, H.
G is friends with A, B, C, D, E, F, H.
H is friends with A, B, C, D, E, F, G.

We need to determine if the chromatic number of this graph, χ(G), is less than or equal to 4.

Consider the subset of people {Alice, Bob, Dave, George, Heather}, or {A, B, D, G, H}. Let's check if these 5 people are all friends with each other. This corresponds to checking if the subgraph induced by these 5 vertices is a complete graph K5.
1.  Alice (A) is friends with Bob (B), Dave (D), George (G), and Heather (H).
2.  Bob (B) is friends with Alice (A), Dave (D), George (G), and Heather (H). (Also friends with C and E).
3.  Dave (D) is friends with Alice (A), Bob (B), George (G), and Heather (H). (Also friends with C, E, F).
4.  George (G) is friends with Alice (A), Bob (B), Dave (D), and Heather (H). (Also friends with C, E, F).
5.  Heather (H) is friends with Alice (A), Bob (B), Dave (D), and George (G). (Also friends with C, E, F).

From the list of friendships, we can confirm that every pair of people within the set {A, B, D, G, H} are friends with each other. For example:
- A and B are friends.
- A and D are friends.
- A and G are friends.
- A and H are friends.
- B and D are friends.
- B and G are friends.
- B and H are friends.
- D and G are friends.
- D and H are friends.
- G and H are friends.

This means that the vertices A, B, D, G, H form a complete subgraph K5 (a clique of size 5). In any valid coloring of the graph G, all vertices in this K5 subgraph must be assigned different colors. Since there are 5 vertices in this subgraph, we need at least 5 distinct colors to color them.

However, we only have 4 colors available (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow). Since the graph contains a K5 subgraph, it requires at least 5 colors (χ(G) ≥ 5). Therefore, it is impossible to color the graph with only 4 colors while satisfying the condition that no two friends wear the same color shirt.
