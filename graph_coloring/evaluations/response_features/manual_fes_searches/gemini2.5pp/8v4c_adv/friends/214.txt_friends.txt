Let's analyze the friendships to see if there are any groups where everyone is friends with everyone else within that group (a clique).

Consider the following group of 5 people: Bob, Dave, Fran, George, and Heather.
Let's check the friendships within this group:
*   Bob is friends with Dave, Fran, George, and Heather. (All 4 others)
*   Dave is friends with Bob, Fran, George, and Heather. (All 4 others)
*   Fran is friends with Bob, Dave, George, and Heather. (All 4 others)
*   George is friends with Bob, Dave, Fran, and Heather. (All 4 others)
*   Heather is friends with Bob, Dave, Fran, and George. (All 4 others)

Since Bob, Dave, Fran, George, and Heather are all mutually friends, each of these 5 people must wear a different colored shirt. However, there are only 4 available colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow). It is therefore impossible to assign shirts such that no two friends wear the same color.

Let's analyze the friendships to see if there are any groups where everyone is friends with everyone else within that group (a clique).

Consider the following group of 5 people: #1, #3, #5, #6, and #7.
Let's check the friendships within this group:
*   #1 is friends with #3, #5, #6, and #7. (All 4 others)
*   #3 is friends with #1, #5, #6, and #7. (All 4 others)
*   #5 is friends with #1, #3, #6, and #7. (All 4 others)
*   #6 is friends with #1, #3, #5, and #7. (All 4 others)
*   #7 is friends with #1, #3, #5, and #6. (All 4 others)

Since #1, #3, #5, #6, and #7 are all mutually friends, each of these 5 people must wear a different colored shirt. However, there are only 4 available colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow). It is therefore impossible to assign shirts such that no two friends wear the same color.
