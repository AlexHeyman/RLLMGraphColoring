To determine if it is possible for the 8 people to wear shirts of 4 different colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow) such that no two friends wear the same color shirt, we can model this problem using graph coloring. Let the 8 people be the vertices of a graph, and let an edge connect two vertices if the corresponding people are friends. We need to determine if this graph can be colored with 4 colors such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.

Let the people be represented by their initials: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H.
The friendships define the edges of the graph:
A is friends with B, C, D, E, G, H.
B is friends with A, D, E, F, G, H.
C is friends with A, D, E, F, G, H.
D is friends with A, B, C, F, G, H.
E is friends with A, B, C, F, G, H.
F is friends with B, C, D, E, H.
G is friends with A, B, C, D, E, H.
H is friends with A, B, C, D, E, F, G.

A key concept in graph coloring is a clique. A clique is a subset of vertices such that every two distinct vertices in the clique are adjacent (i.e., they are friends). If a graph contains a clique of size k, then at least k colors are required to color the graph, because all vertices in the clique must have different colors. The size of the largest clique in a graph G is denoted by ω(G), and the minimum number of colors needed to color the graph G is denoted by χ(G). We know that χ(G) ≥ ω(G).

Let's examine the set of people {Alice, Bob, Dave, George, Heather}, or {A, B, D, G, H}. Let's check if they form a clique of size 5.
1.  Is A friends with B, D, G, H? Yes, A's friends are {B, C, D, E, G, H}.
2.  Is B friends with A, D, G, H? Yes, B's friends are {A, D, E, F, G, H}.
3.  Is D friends with A, B, G, H? Yes, D's friends are {A, B, C, F, G, H}.
4.  Is G friends with A, B, D, H? Yes, G's friends are {A, B, C, D, E, H}.
5.  Is H friends with A, B, D, G? Yes, H's friends are {A, B, C, D, E, F, G}.

Since every pair of people in the set {A, B, D, G, H} are friends, this set forms a clique of size 5. This means that these 5 people must all wear different colored shirts. However, there are only 4 colors available (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow). Therefore, it is impossible to assign colors to these 5 people such that no two friends have the same color.

Since it's impossible to color even this subset of 5 people according to the rules with only 4 colors, it is impossible to color all 8 people according to the rules.
