To determine if the graph can be colored with 4 colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow) such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color, we need to check if the graph's chromatic number is less than or equal to 4.

A key property related to graph coloring is the clique number, ω(G), which is the size of the largest complete subgraph (clique) within the graph G. The chromatic number χ(G) must be greater than or equal to the clique number (χ(G) ≥ ω(G)). If we can find a clique of size 5 (a K5 subgraph), then we would need at least 5 colors, making a 4-coloring impossible.

Let's examine the vertices and their connections, looking for a potential K5. Consider the vertices with high degrees, like 1, 4, 6, and 7.

Let's test the set of vertices {1, 4, 5, 6, 7}. For this to be a K5, every pair of vertices within this set must be connected by an edge. Let's check the required edges using the provided edge list:
*   Edges involving vertex 1: (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7) - All present.
*   Edges involving vertex 4: (1,4), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7) - All present.
*   Edges involving vertex 5: (1,5), (4,5), (5,6), (5,7) - All present.
*   Edges involving vertex 6: (1,6), (4,6), (5,6). We also need (6,7). Let's check the neighbors of 7: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Yes, 7 is connected to 6, so the edge (6,7) exists. All required edges involving 6 within the set are present.
*   Edges involving vertex 7: (1,7), (4,7), (5,7), (6,7) - All present (as confirmed above).

Since all pairs of vertices in the set {1, 4, 5, 6, 7} are connected by an edge, this set forms a K5 subgraph.

To color a K5 subgraph, each of the 5 vertices must receive a different color, as every vertex is adjacent to every other vertex in the subgraph. Therefore, we need at least 5 colors to color this graph properly.

Since we only have 4 colors available (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow), it is impossible to color this graph according to the rules.
