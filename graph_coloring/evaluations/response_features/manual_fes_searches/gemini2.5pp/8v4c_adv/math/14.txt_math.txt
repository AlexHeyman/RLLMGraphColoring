Let V = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} be the set of vertices and E be the set of edges.
We want to determine if this graph G = (V, E) is 4-colorable. That is, can we assign one of four colors (say, Red, Green, Blue, Yellow) to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color?

A common obstruction to k-coloring is the presence of a (k+1)-clique, which is a subgraph where every pair of vertices is connected by an edge. In our case, we are looking for 4-colorability, so we should check if there is a 5-clique (K5).

Let's examine the neighborhood of vertex 4, which has the highest degree (7): N(4) = {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7}.
Let's examine the neighborhood of vertex 6: N(6) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7}.
Let's examine the neighborhood of vertex 7: N(7) = {2, 3, 4, 6}.

Consider the set of vertices S = {2, 3, 4, 6, 7}. Let's check the edges within this set:
(2,4) exists.
(2,6) exists.
(2,7) exists.
(3,4) exists.
(3,6) exists.
(3,7) exists.
(4,6) exists.
(4,7) exists.
(6,7) does NOT exist.
(2,3) does NOT exist.

This subgraph is not a K5.

Let's try to find a valid 4-coloring using colors {R, G, B, Y}.
Consider the subgraph induced by the neighbors of vertex 7, which are {2, 3, 4, 6}.
Edges between these neighbors are: (2,4), (2,6), (3,4), (3,6), (4,6).
Notice that {2, 4, 6} form a triangle (K3), and {3, 4, 6} form a triangle (K3).
Since (2,3) is not an edge, these four vertices {2, 3, 4, 6} do not form a K4.

Let's try to color the graph. We can start with the neighbors of 7.
Since {2, 4, 6} form a K3, they must receive 3 different colors.
Let Color(4) = Red
Let Color(2) = Green
Let Color(6) = Blue

Now consider vertex 3. Its neighbors among {2, 4, 6} are 4 (Red) and 6 (Blue). Vertex 3 is not adjacent to 2 (Green). So, Color(3) must be different from Red and Blue. Color(3) can be Green or Yellow.

Now consider vertex 7. Its neighbors are {2, 3, 4, 6}.
Case 1: Color(3) = Green.
The neighbors of 7 have colors: Color(2)=Green, Color(3)=Green, Color(4)=Red, Color(6)=Blue.
The set of colors used by neighbors is {Red, Green, Blue}.
So, we can assign Color(7) = Yellow.

Case 2: Color(3) = Yellow.
The neighbors of 7 have colors: Color(2)=Green, Color(3)=Yellow, Color(4)=Red, Color(6)=Blue.
The set of colors used by neighbors is {Red, Green, Blue, Yellow}.
In this case, vertex 7 cannot be colored.

Therefore, any valid 4-coloring *must* have Color(3) = Color(2) (or symmetrically, Color(2) = Color(3)) relative to the colors of 4 and 6, assuming {2,4,6} get distinct colors.
Let's proceed with the coloring found in Case 1:
Color(4) = Red
Color(2) = Green
Color(6) = Blue
Color(3) = Green
Color(7) = Yellow

Now let's color the remaining vertices {0, 1, 5}.
Vertex 1: Neighbors are {0, 2, 4, 5, 6}. Known neighbors have colors: Color(2)=Green, Color(4)=Red, Color(6)=Blue. The neighbors {2, 4, 6} use 3 distinct colors. Vertex 1 must not be Red, Green, or Blue.
So, Color(1) = Yellow.

Vertex 5: Neighbors are {0, 1, 3, 4, 6}. Known neighbors have colors: Color(1)=Yellow, Color(3)=Green, Color(4)=Red, Color(6)=Blue. The neighbors {1, 3, 4, 6} use all 4 distinct colors {Yellow, Green, Red, Blue}.
Vertex 5 cannot be colored.

Since we reached a contradiction starting from the necessary condition derived from coloring vertex 7 and its neighbors, it is impossible to color this graph with 4 colors.
