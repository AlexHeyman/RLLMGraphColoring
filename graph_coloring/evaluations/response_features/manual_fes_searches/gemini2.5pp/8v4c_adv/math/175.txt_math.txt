Okay, let's analyze the graph G = (V, E) where V = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} and E is the given set of edges. We want to determine if a 4-coloring exists.

1.  **Identify High-Degree Vertices:** Let's find the degree of each vertex (number of neighbors).
    *   deg(0): Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7} -> Degree 6
    *   deg(1): Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 6, 7} -> Degree 5
    *   deg(2): Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} -> Degree 7
    *   deg(3): Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 4, 5} -> Degree 5
    *   deg(4): Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 5, 7} -> Degree 5
    *   deg(5): Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 6, 7} -> Degree 5
    *   deg(6): Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 5, 7} -> Degree 5
    *   deg(7): Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6} -> Degree 6

2.  **Focus on Vertex 2:** Vertex 2 has the highest degree (7). It is connected to every other vertex in the graph: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}.

3.  **Consider the Subgraph of Neighbors:** Let H be the subgraph induced by the neighbors of vertex 2, i.e., H consists of the vertices V' = {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} and all edges from the original graph E that connect two vertices within V'.
    *   Edges in H: {(0,1), (0,3), (0,4), (0,6), (0,7), (1,3), (1,6), (1,7), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,7), (5,6), (5,7)}

4.  **Coloring Requirement:** In any valid coloring of the original graph G, vertex 2 must have a color different from all vertices in H. If we use 4 colors (say C1, C2, C3, C4) for G, let vertex 2 have color C1. Then all vertices in H must be colored using only C2, C3, and C4. This means the subgraph H must be 3-colorable.

5.  **Check if H is 3-Colorable:** Let's try to color H using 3 colors (Red, Green, Blue).
    *   Color 0: Red
    *   Color 1: Neighbors in H: {0, 3, 6, 7}. Neighbor 0 is Red. Color 1: Green.
    *   Color 3: Neighbors in H: {0, 1, 4, 5}. Neighbors 0(Red), 1(Green). Color 3: Blue.
    *   Color 4: Neighbors in H: {0, 3, 5, 7}. Neighbors 0(Red), 3(Blue). Color 4: Green.
    *   Color 5: Neighbors in H: {3, 4, 6, 7}. Neighbors 3(Blue), 4(Green). Color 5: Red.
    *   Color 6: Neighbors in H: {0, 1, 5, 7}. Neighbors 0(Red), 1(Green), 5(Red). Needs Blue. Color 6: Blue.
    *   Color 7: Neighbors in H: {0, 1, 4, 5, 6}. Neighbors 0(Red), 1(Green), 4(Green), 5(Red), 6(Blue). The neighbors of vertex 7 in H have colors Red, Green, and Blue. Vertex 7 cannot be colored with any of these three colors.

6.  **Conclusion:** The subgraph H induced by the neighbors of vertex 2 requires at least 4 colors. Since vertex 2 is adjacent to all vertices in H, vertex 2 must have a color different from all colors used in H. If H needs 4 colors, then vertex 2 requires a 5th color. Therefore, the original graph G cannot be colored with only 4 colors.
