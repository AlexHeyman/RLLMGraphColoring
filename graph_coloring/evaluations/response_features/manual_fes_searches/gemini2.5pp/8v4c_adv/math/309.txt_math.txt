Let G = (V, E) be the graph with V = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} and E as given. We want to determine if G can be colored with 4 colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow) such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. This is equivalent to determining if the chromatic number χ(G) is less than or equal to 4.

Let's list the neighbors for each vertex:
N(0) = {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7}
N(1) = {0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
N(2) = {0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
N(3) = {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7}
N(4) = {0, 1, 2, 3, 6}
N(5) = {0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7}
N(6) = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
N(7) = {0, 1, 2, 3, 5}

We look for structures that might require many colors, such as large cliques. A clique is a subset of vertices where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge. If a graph contains a clique of size k (Kk), then χ(G) >= k.

Let's check for a K5 (a clique of size 5). If a K5 exists, then χ(G) >= 5, and 4-coloring is impossible.
Consider the set {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}. The edges (1,2) and (0,3) are missing. This is not a K5.
Consider the set {0, 1, 2, 3, 5}. The edges (0,3) and (1,2) are missing. This is not a K5.
Consider the set {0, 1, 2, 3, 6}. The edges (0,3) and (1,2) are missing. This is not a K5.
Consider the set {1, 3, 4, 6}. Edges: (1,3), (1,4), (1,6), (3,4), (3,6), (4,6). This forms a K4. Is there a vertex adjacent to all of these?
N(0) contains 1, 4, 6 but not 3.
N(2) contains 3, 4, 6 but not 1.
N(5) contains 1, 3, 6 but not 4.
N(7) contains 1, 3 but not 4, 6.
No vertex forms a K5 with {1, 3, 4, 6}.

Let's try a different approach. Consider the subgraph induced by S' = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Let G' = G[S'].
The edges in G' are those edges from E where both endpoints are in S'.
E(G') = {(0,1), (0,2), (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,4), (3,5)}
Note that edge (4,5) is missing in G.

Let's determine the chromatic number of G', χ(G').
Can we color G' with 3 colors? Let the colors be R, G, B.
Try a greedy coloring:
C(0) = R
C(1) = G (adj 0)
C(2) = B (adj 0)
C(3) = ? (adj 1(G), 2(B)). Must be R. C(3) = R.
Check edges for {0,1,2,3}: (0,1)RG, (0,2)RB, (1,3)GR, (2,3)BR. All valid. (0,3)RR is okay since (0,3) is not an edge. (1,2)GB is okay since (1,2) is not an edge.
C(4) = ? (adj 0(R), 1(G), 2(B), 3(R)). Neighbors of 4 in G' are {0, 1, 2, 3}.
C(4) must be different from C(0)=R, C(1)=G, C(2)=B, C(3)=R.
C(4) must be different from R, G, B.
This requires a 4th color. Let C(4) = Y (Yellow).
So, χ(G') >= 4.

Let's find a 4-coloring for G'.
C(0) = R
C(1) = G
C(2) = B
C(3) = R
C(4) = Y (different from R, G, B)
C(5) = ? (adj 0(R), 1(G), 2(B), 3(R)). Neighbors of 5 in G' are {0, 1, 2, 3}.
C(5) must be different from C(0)=R, C(1)=G, C(2)=B, C(3)=R.
C(5) must be different from R, G, B.
We can set C(5) = Y.
Is this coloring valid? We need to check the edge constraints for C(5)=Y.
(0,5)RY, (1,5)GY, (2,5)BY, (3,5)RY. All valid.
We also need to check if C(4)=Y and C(5)=Y is valid. Vertices 4 and 5 are adjacent? No, the edge (4,5) is missing in G. So this is allowed.
The coloring C = {0:R, 1:G, 2:B, 3:R, 4:Y, 5:Y} is a valid 4-coloring for G'.
Thus, χ(G') = 4.

Now consider vertex 6. The neighbors of vertex 6 are N(6) = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.
Vertex 6 is adjacent to all vertices in S' = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.
Let C_G be any valid 4-coloring of the entire graph G using the colors {Red, Green, Blue, Yellow}.
The restriction of C_G to the subgraph G', denoted C_G|G', must be a valid 4-coloring of G'.
Since χ(G') = 4, C_G|G' must use all 4 colors.
This means the set of colors {C_G(0), C_G(1), C_G(2), C_G(3), C_G(4), C_G(5)} must be exactly {Red, Green, Blue, Yellow}.
The color of vertex 6, C_G(6), must be different from the colors of all its neighbors.
C_G(6) must be different from C_G(0), C_G(1), C_G(2), C_G(3), C_G(4), C_G(5).
Therefore, C_G(6) must be different from Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow.
This requires a 5th color for vertex 6.
Since we only have 4 colors available, no such coloring C_G can exist.

The graph G is not 4-colorable. The chromatic number χ(G) is 5.
