Let V = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} be the set of vertices.
Let E be the set of edges:
E = {(0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,4), (3,6), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,6), (5,7)}

We want to determine if this graph can be colored using 4 colors (say, Red, Green, Blue, Yellow) such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. This is equivalent to checking if the chromatic number of the graph, Ï‡(G), is less than or equal to 4.

A key concept in graph coloring is that a clique of size k (a subgraph where every pair of vertices is connected by an edge) requires k distinct colors. If we can find a clique of size 5 (a K5 subgraph), then 4 colors are insufficient.

Let's examine the neighborhood of some high-degree vertices.
Neighbors(0): {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
Neighbors(4): {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7}
Neighbors(5): {0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7}

Consider the set of vertices S = {0, 4, 5, 6, 7}. Let's check the edges within this set:
Edges involving 0: (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7) - All exist.
Edges involving 4: (4,0), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7) - All exist.
Edges involving 5: (5,0), (5,4), (5,6), (5,7) - All exist.
Edges involving 6: (6,0), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,7) - Edges within S are (6,0), (6,4), (6,5). We need to check if (6,7) exists. Looking at the original edge list, (6,7) is *not* present. So S is not a K5.

Let's reconsider vertex 7 and its neighbors.
Neighbors(7): {0, 4, 5, 6}
Let's check if these neighbors form a clique (K4). We need to check the edges between pairs of vertices in {0, 4, 5, 6}.
(0,4) - Yes
(0,5) - Yes
(0,6) - Yes
(4,5) - Yes
(4,6) - Yes
(5,6) - Yes
Yes, the set {0, 4, 5, 6} forms a K4.

In any valid 4-coloring, the vertices 0, 4, 5, and 6 must receive four distinct colors. Let's assign them:
Color(0) = C1
Color(4) = C2
Color(5) = C3
Color(6) = C4
where C1, C2, C3, C4 are four distinct colors (e.g., Red, Green, Blue, Yellow).

Now consider vertex 7. Vertex 7 is adjacent to all vertices in the set {0, 4, 5, 6}.
This means:
Color(7) must be different from Color(0) = C1
Color(7) must be different from Color(4) = C2
Color(7) must be different from Color(5) = C3
Color(7) must be different from Color(6) = C4

Since C1, C2, C3, C4 represent all four available colors, there is no available color for vertex 7 that satisfies the condition that adjacent vertices must have different colors.

Therefore, the graph cannot be colored with only four colors.
