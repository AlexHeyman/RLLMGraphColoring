Okay, let's analyze the graph and the coloring requirement.

1.  **Vertices:** V = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
2.  **Edges:** E = {(0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,2), (1,6), (1,7), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,6), (5,7)}
3.  **Colors:** Red, Green, Blue, Yellow (4 colors)
4.  **Constraint:** Adjacent vertices must have different colors.

Let's determine the neighbors (adjacency list) for each vertex:
*   N(0): {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7}
*   N(1): {0, 2, 6, 7}
*   N(2): {0, 1, 5, 6, 7}
*   N(3): {0, 4, 5, 6, 7}
*   N(4): {3, 5, 6, 7}
*   N(5): {0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7}
*   N(6): {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7}
*   N(7): {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

We are looking for a 4-coloring. A common reason why a graph might not be k-colorable is if it contains a (k+1)-clique (a complete subgraph with k+1 vertices). Let's check for a 5-clique (K5).

Consider the set of vertices {0, 1, 2, 6, 7}. Let's check if all pairs are connected:
*   (0,1) - Yes
*   (0,2) - Yes
*   (0,6) - Yes
*   (0,7) - Yes
*   (1,2) - Yes
*   (1,6) - Yes
*   (1,7) - Yes
*   (2,6) - Yes
*   (2,7) - Yes
*   (6,7) - Yes (Vertex 6 is adjacent to 7, and vertex 7 is adjacent to 6, based on the neighbor lists derived from the edge set).

Wait, let me re-verify the edge (6,7) from the original list. The provided edge list is:
{(0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,2), (1,6), (1,7), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,6), (5,7)}
The edge (6,7) is *not* explicitly listed. Let's re-derive the neighbor lists carefully.
*   N(0): {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7} (Correct)
*   N(1): {0, 2, 6, 7} (Correct)
*   N(2): {0, 1, 5, 6, 7} (Correct)
*   N(3): {0, 4, 5, 6, 7} (Correct)
*   N(4): {3, 5, 6, 7} (Correct)
*   N(5): {0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7} (Correct)
*   N(6): {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7} (Edges: (0,6), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6). Need to check for (7,6) or (6,7). Ah, (5,7) is the last edge involving 7 listed. Let's check edges involving 6: (0,6), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6). No (6,7) edge listed.)
*   N(7): {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} (Edges: (0,7), (1,7), (2,7), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7). No (6,7) edge listed.)

My previous derivation of N(6) and N(7) was incorrect based on the provided list.
Corrected Neighbor Lists:
*   N(6): {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} (Degree 6)
*   N(7): {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} (Degree 6)

Now, let's reconsider the problem. The graph does *not* contain the edge (6,7).

Consider the subgraph induced by the vertices H = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.
Vertex 6 is adjacent to all vertices in H.
Vertex 7 is adjacent to all vertices in H.

If the subgraph H requires 4 colors, then vertex 6 (being adjacent to all of H) would require a 5th color. Let's see if H requires 4 colors.
We need to color {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} using the edges within this set:
E(H) = {(0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,5), (1,2), (2,5), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)}

Let's try to 3-color H (using Red, Green, Blue):
1.  Color 0: Red
2.  Color 1 (N={0,2}): Green (must be different from Red)
3.  Color 2 (N={0,1,5}): Blue (must be different from Red, Green)
4.  Color 3 (N={0,4,5}): Green (must be different from Red)
5.  Color 4 (N={3,5}): Red (must be different from Green)
6.  Color 5 (N={0,2,3,4}): Neighbors are 0(Red), 2(Blue), 3(Green), 4(Red). The neighbor colors are Red, Blue, Green. All 3 colors are used. Vertex 5 cannot be colored Red, Green, or Blue.

Therefore, the subgraph H induced by {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} requires at least 4 colors. Let's call the 4th color Yellow.
A possible 4-coloring for H is:
*   0: Red
*   1: Green
*   2: Blue
*   3: Green
*   4: Red
*   5: Yellow

Now consider vertex 6. It is adjacent to {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. The colors of these neighbors in our partial coloring are {Red, Green, Blue, Green, Red, Yellow}. The set of distinct colors used by the neighbors of 6 is {Red, Green, Blue, Yellow}. Since vertex 6 must have a color different from all its neighbors, and its neighbors use all 4 available colors, there is no color available for vertex 6.

The graph requires at least 5 colors because vertex 6 is adjacent to the subgraph H={0,1,2,3,4,5}, and H requires 4 colors (χ(H)=4). This structure means χ(G) >= χ(H) + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5.

Since we only have 4 colors available, it is impossible to color this graph according to the rules.

Impossible
