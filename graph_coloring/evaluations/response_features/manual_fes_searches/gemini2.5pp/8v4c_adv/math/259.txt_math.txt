Let V be the set of vertices {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} and E be the set of edges given.
We want to determine if this graph G = (V, E) can be colored using 4 colors such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. This is equivalent to asking if the chromatic number of the graph, χ(G), is less than or equal to 4.

The chromatic number of a graph is the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. A well-known property is that if a graph G contains a clique of size k (a subgraph Kk where all k vertices are connected to each other), then the chromatic number χ(G) must be at least k (χ(G) ≥ k). This is because all vertices in a clique must receive different colors.

Let's examine the subgraph induced by the set of vertices {1, 2, 4, 6, 7}. We need to check if all pairs of vertices in this set are connected by an edge in E.
The pairs are:
(1,2): Edge (1,2) is in E.
(1,4): Edge (1,4) is in E.
(1,6): Edge (1,6) is in E.
(1,7): Edge (1,7) is in E.
(2,4): Edge (2,4) is in E.
(2,6): Edge (2,6) is in E.
(2,7): Edge (2,7) is in E.
(4,6): Edge (4,6) is in E.
(4,7): Edge (4,7) is in E.
(6,7): Edge (6,7) is in E.

All 10 pairs of vertices within the set {1, 2, 4, 6, 7} are connected by an edge. This means that the subgraph induced by these 5 vertices is a complete graph K5.

Since the graph G contains a K5 subgraph, any valid coloring of G must assign 5 distinct colors to the vertices {1, 2, 4, 6, 7}. Therefore, the chromatic number of G is at least 5 (χ(G) ≥ 5).

We are asked if the graph can be colored with 4 colors (red, green, blue, or yellow). Since the graph requires at least 5 colors, it is impossible to color it with only 4 colors.

Impossible
