To determine if the graph can be colored with 4 colors (red, green, blue, yellow) such that no two adjacent vertices receive the same color, we need to find the chromatic number of the graph, denoted χ(G). If χ(G) ≤ 4, then a 4-coloring is possible. Otherwise, it is impossible.

The graph has 8 vertices V = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} and the set of edges E = {(0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (2,3), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,4), (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,6), (5,7)}.

Let's determine the adjacency list for each vertex:
Adj(0) = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
Adj(1) = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
Adj(2) = {0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7}
Adj(3) = {0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7}
Adj(4) = {0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7}
Adj(5) = {0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7}
Adj(6) = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7}  <- Let me recheck the edge list for vertex 6.
Edges involving 6: (0,6), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6).
Adj(6) = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. (Degree 6)

Edges involving 7: (1,7), (2,7), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7).
Adj(7) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. (Degree 5)

My previous derivation in thought was correct, the edge (6,7) is not present.

Consider the subgraph G' induced by the vertices V' = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.
The edges in G' are the edges from E where both endpoints are in V':
E' = {(0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,4), (4,5)}

Let's try to color G' with 3 colors (say 1, 2, 3).
Color 0 with 1. (0:1)
Color 1 with 2. (1:2) (0 and 1 are not adjacent in G')
Color 2. Neighbors in G' are {0, 1}. Colors are {1, 2}. So, color 2 with 3. (2:3)
Color 3. Neighbors in G' are {0, 1, 2}. Colors are {1, 2, 3}. Vertex 3 is adjacent to vertices with all 3 colors. Therefore, G' cannot be colored with 3 colors. It requires at least 4 colors. χ(G') ≥ 4.

Let's find a 4-coloring for G'. Let the colors be {R, G, B, Y}.
0: R
1: G
2: B (Adj to 0(R), 1(G))
3: Y (Adj to 0(R), 1(G), 2(B))
4: ? (Adj to 0(R), 1(G), 3(Y)). Available colors: B. Color 4 with B. (4:B)
5: ? (Adj to 0(R), 1(G), 2(B), 4(B)). Available colors: Y. Color 5 with Y. (5:Y)

Let's check this 4-coloring for G':
0: R, Neighbors {2(B), 3(Y), 4(B), 5(Y)}. OK.
1: G, Neighbors {2(B), 3(Y), 4(B), 5(Y)}. OK.
2: B, Neighbors {0(R), 1(G), 3(Y), 5(Y)}. OK.
3: Y, Neighbors {0(R), 1(G), 2(B), 4(B)}. OK.
4: B, Neighbors {0(R), 1(G), 3(Y), 5(Y)}. OK.
5: Y, Neighbors {0(R), 1(G), 2(B), 4(B)}. OK.
This is a valid 4-coloring for G'. Thus, χ(G') = 4.

Now consider vertex 6 in the original graph G.
Adj(6) = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.
Vertex 6 is adjacent to all vertices in G'.
In any valid 4-coloring of the entire graph G, the vertices {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} must be colored such that adjacent vertices have different colors. This constitutes a coloring of G'. Since χ(G') = 4, any valid coloring of G' must use at least 4 distinct colors for these vertices.
Let C be a valid 4-coloring of G, using colors {c1, c2, c3, c4}. The set of colors used for {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} must be S = {C(0), C(1), C(2), C(3), C(4), C(5)}. We know |S| ≥ 4. Since we only have 4 colors available, S must be exactly {c1, c2, c3, c4}.
The color of vertex 6, C(6), must be different from the colors of all its neighbors: C(0), C(1), C(2), C(3), C(4), C(5).
So, C(6) must be different from all colors in S. Since S contains all 4 available colors, there is no available color for C(6).

Therefore, the graph G cannot be colored with only 4 colors. It requires at least 5 colors (χ(G) ≥ 5).
