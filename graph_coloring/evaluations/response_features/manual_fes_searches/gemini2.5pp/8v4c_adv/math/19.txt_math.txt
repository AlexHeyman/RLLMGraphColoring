Let the four colors be C1, C2, C3, C4.
We need to determine if we can assign one of these four colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.

First, let's identify the neighbors of each vertex:
*   Neighbors(0): {1, 3, 4, 5}
*   Neighbors(1): {0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7}
*   Neighbors(2): {1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
*   Neighbors(3): {0, 1, 2, 5}
*   Neighbors(4): {0, 2, 5, 6, 7}
*   Neighbors(5): {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7}
*   Neighbors(6): {1, 2, 4, 5, 7}
*   Neighbors(7): {1, 2, 4, 5, 6}

The chromatic number of a graph (the minimum number of colors needed) is at least the size of the largest clique (a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are adjacent). Let's look for cliques.

Consider the subset of vertices {1, 2, 3, 5}. Let's check if they form a clique (K4):
*   (1,2) is an edge.
*   (1,3) is an edge.
*   (1,5) is an edge.
*   (2,3) is an edge.
*   (2,5) is an edge.
*   (3,5) is an edge.
Yes, {1, 2, 3, 5} form a K4. This means we need at least 4 colors. The question is whether 4 colors are sufficient.

Let's assume a 4-coloring exists. Assign 4 distinct colors to the vertices {1, 2, 3, 5}. Let these colors be C1, C2, C3, C4 respectively.
*   Color(1) = C1
*   Color(2) = C2
*   Color(3) = C3
*   Color(5) = C4

Now consider vertex 0. Its neighbors are {1, 3, 4, 5}.
*   Vertex 0 must have a color different from Color(1)=C1, Color(3)=C3, and Color(5)=C4.
*   The only available color from the set {C1, C2, C3, C4} is C2.
*   Therefore, Color(0) must be C2.

Now consider vertex 4. Its neighbors are {0, 2, 5, 6, 7}.
*   Vertex 4 must have a color different from its neighbors. Let's look at the colors of neighbors {0, 2, 5}.
*   We deduced Color(0) = C2.
*   We initially assigned Color(2) = C2.
*   We initially assigned Color(5) = C4.
*   So, vertex 4 must have a color different from C2 (neighbor 0), C2 (neighbor 2), and C4 (neighbor 5).
*   However, vertex 4 is adjacent to both vertex 0 and vertex 2. Since both vertex 0 and vertex 2 must be assigned the same color (C2) in any valid 4-coloring extending the assignment to the K4 {1, 2, 3, 5}, vertex 4 cannot be colored. It needs to be different from C2 because of neighbor 0, and it needs to be different from C2 because of neighbor 2. This doesn't create a contradiction in itself, but it severely restricts the color choices for 4.
*   The crucial point is that vertex 4 is adjacent to *both* 0 and 2. If a coloring exists, Color(4) must be different from Color(0) and Color(4) must be different from Color(2). But we found that any valid 4-coloring *requires* Color(0) = Color(2). This means Color(4) must be different from the color assigned to 0 and 2.
*   The neighbors of 4 whose colors we know are 0 (must be C2), 2 (must be C2), and 5 (is C4). So, 4 must have a color different from C2 and C4. The available colors are C1 and C3. Let's try assigning Color(4) = C1.

Let's check if this leads to a contradiction elsewhere.
Current partial coloring:
*   0: C2
*   1: C1
*   2: C2
*   3: C3
*   4: C1 (Chosen tentatively)
*   5: C4

Check adjacencies:
*   (0,1): C2 != C1 (Ok)
*   (0,3): C2 != C3 (Ok)
*   (0,4): C2 != C1 (Ok)
*   (0,5): C2 != C4 (Ok)
*   (1,2): C1 != C2 (Ok)
*   (1,3): C1 != C3 (Ok)
*   (1,5): C1 != C4 (Ok)
*   (2,3): C2 != C3 (Ok)
*   (2,4): C2 != C1 (Ok)
*   (2,5): C2 != C4 (Ok)
*   (3,5): C3 != C4 (Ok)
*   (4,5): C1 != C4 (Ok)

This seems consistent so far for vertices 0 through 5. Now consider vertices 6 and 7.
*   Vertex 6: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 5, 7}. Colors of neighbors {1(C1), 2(C2), 4(C1), 5(C4)}.
    *   Vertex 6 is adjacent to vertex 1 (C1) and vertex 4 (C1). This is impossible. A vertex cannot be adjacent to two vertices of the same color.

Let's re-verify the adjacency list and the logic.
Neighbors(6): {1, 2, 4, 5, 7}
Neighbors(1): {0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7}
Neighbors(4): {0, 2, 5, 6, 7}
Edge (1,6) exists. Edge (4,6) exists.

The derived partial coloring was:
0: C2
1: C1
2: C2
3: C3
4: C1
5: C4

In this partial coloring, vertex 1 has color C1 and vertex 4 has color C1. Vertex 6 is adjacent to both vertex 1 and vertex 4. Therefore, vertex 6 cannot be colored, as it would need a color different from C1 (due to neighbor 1) and C1 (due to neighbor 4).

This contradiction arose directly from the fact that the K4 {1, 2, 3, 5} forced Color(0)=C2 and Color(2)=C2. Then, the neighbors of 4 ({0, 2, 5}) forced Color(4) to be either C1 or C3. We chose C1. If we had chosen C3:
*   0: C2
*   1: C1
*   2: C2
*   3: C3
*   4: C3
*   5: C4
Check vertex 3 (C3) and vertex 4 (C3). Are they adjacent? Neighbors(3) = {0, 1, 2, 5}. No, (3,4) is not an edge. This assignment is potentially valid so far.
Now check vertex 6 again. Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 5, 7}. Colors of neighbors {1(C1), 2(C2), 4(C3), 5(C4)}. All four colors C1, C2, C3, C4 are used by the neighbors {1, 2, 4, 5} of vertex 6. Vertex 6 is also adjacent to vertex 7, but even without considering 7, vertex 6 cannot be colored as it must be different from C1, C2, C3, and C4.

Since starting with an arbitrary assignment of 4 distinct colors to the K4 {1, 2, 3, 5} leads to a situation where vertex 6 cannot be colored, no such 4-coloring is possible.

Impossible
