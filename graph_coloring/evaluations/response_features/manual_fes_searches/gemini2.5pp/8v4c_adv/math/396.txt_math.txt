Let $G = (V, E)$ be the graph with $V = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}$ and $E$ the given set of edges. We want to determine if $G$ is 4-colorable. Let the set of 4 colors be $C = \{\text{Red, Green, Blue, Yellow}\}$. A 4-coloring is a function $c: V \to C$ such that for every edge $(u, v) \in E$, $c(u) \ne c(v)$.

Let $S = \{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}$. From the edge list, we can observe that:
1. Vertex 0 is adjacent to all vertices in $S$.
2. Vertex 1 is adjacent to all vertices in $S$.
3. Vertices 0 and 1 are not adjacent, i.e., $(0, 1) \notin E$.

Let $c$ be a hypothetical 4-coloring of $G$.
Let $c(0)$ be the color assigned to vertex 0, and $c(1)$ be the color assigned to vertex 1.
Since 0 is adjacent to all vertices in $S$, the color $c(0)$ must be different from the color of any vertex in $S$. That is, $c(0) \notin \{c(v) | v \in S\}$.
Similarly, since 1 is adjacent to all vertices in $S$, the color $c(1)$ must be different from the color of any vertex in $S$. That is, $c(1) \notin \{c(v) | v \in S\}$.

Let $C_S = \{c(v) | v \in S\}$ be the set of colors used for the vertices in $S$.
We have two cases for the colors of vertices 0 and 1:

Case 1: $c(0) = c(1)$. Let this color be $k_1$. Then $k_1 \notin C_S$. This implies that all vertices in $S$ must be colored using colors from $C \setminus \{k_1\}$. There are $4 - 1 = 3$ available colors for the vertices in $S$. This means that the subgraph induced by $S$, denoted as $G[S]$, must be 3-colorable.

Case 2: $c(0) \ne c(1)$. Let $c(0) = k_1$ and $c(1) = k_2$. Then $k_1 \notin C_S$ and $k_2 \notin C_S$. This implies that all vertices in $S$ must be colored using colors from $C \setminus \{k_1, k_2\}$. There are $4 - 2 = 2$ available colors for the vertices in $S$. This means that the subgraph $G[S]$ must be 2-colorable (i.e., bipartite).

Let's analyze the subgraph $G[S]$. The vertices are $S = \{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}$. The edges within $S$ are $E_S = \{(2,3), (2,4), (2,6), (2,7), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,6), (5,7)\}$.
First, let's check if $G[S]$ is 2-colorable. A graph is 2-colorable if and only if it is bipartite, which means it contains no odd cycles. The vertices {3, 4, 5} form a triangle in $G[S]$ because the edges (3,4), (3,5), and (4,5) are all in $E_S$. Since $G[S]$ contains a cycle of length 3, it is not bipartite. Thus, $G[S]$ is not 2-colorable. This eliminates Case 2.

Now we must check if $G[S]$ is 3-colorable (Case 1). Let's try to color $G[S]$ using 3 colors, say {1, 2, 3}.
Consider the subgraph $H = G[\{2, 4, 5, 6, 7\}]$. $H$ is an induced subgraph of $G[S]$. If $G[S]$ is 3-colorable, then $H$ must also be 3-colorable.
Let's try to color $H$ with 3 colors. The vertices are {2, 4, 5, 6, 7}. The edges are {(2,4), (2,6), (2,7), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,6), (5,7)}.
Let's use a greedy approach. Assign color 1 to vertex 4: $c(4)=1$.
Vertex 2 is adjacent to 4, so $c(2) \ne 1$. Let $c(2)=2$.
Vertex 5 is adjacent to 4, so $c(5) \ne 1$. Vertices 2 and 5 are not adjacent in H. Let's try $c(5)=2$.
Vertex 6 is adjacent to 2, 4, 5. The colors of these neighbors are $c(2)=2, c(4)=1, c(5)=2$. The set of neighbor colors is {1, 2}. So $c(6)$ must be 3.
Vertex 7 is adjacent to 2, 4, 5, 6. The colors of these neighbors are $c(2)=2, c(4)=1, c(5)=2, c(6)=3$. The set of neighbor colors is {1, 2, 3}. Vertex 7 must have a color different from 1, 2, and 3. This requires a 4th color.
Let's backtrack and try $c(5)=3$.
$c(4)=1, c(2)=2, c(5)=3$.
Vertex 6 is adjacent to 2, 4, 5. The colors are $c(2)=2, c(4)=1, c(5)=3$. The set of neighbor colors is {1, 2, 3}. Vertex 6 must have a color different from 1, 2, and 3. This requires a 4th color.

In both possibilities for $c(5)$, we found that we need a 4th color. This shows that the subgraph $H$ is not 3-colorable. Therefore, $\chi(H) \ge 4$.
Since $H$ is a subgraph of $G[S]$, the chromatic number of $G[S]$ must be at least 4, i.e., $\chi(G[S]) \ge \chi(H) \ge 4$.
So $G[S]$ is not 3-colorable. This eliminates Case 1.

Since both Case 1 and Case 2 lead to contradictions, it is impossible to color the graph $G$ with 4 colors.

Impossible
