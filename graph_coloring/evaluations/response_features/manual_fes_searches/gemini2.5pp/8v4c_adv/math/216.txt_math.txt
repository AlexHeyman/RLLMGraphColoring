1.  **Identify the Goal:** We need to determine if the graph can be colored using 4 colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow) such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.

2.  **Analyze the Graph Structure:** Let's list the vertices and their neighbors (adjacency list):
    *   N(0): {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7}
    *   N(1): {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
    *   N(2): {0, 1, 3, 6, 7}
    *   N(3): {1, 2, 4, 5, 6}
    *   N(4): {0, 1, 3, 6, 7}
    *   N(5): {0, 1, 3, 6, 7}
    *   N(6): {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7}
    *   N(7): {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6}

3.  **Look for Constraints (Cliques):** A clique is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices in the clique are adjacent. If a graph contains a clique of size *k*, it requires at least *k* colors. We have 4 colors available. If we find a clique of size 5 (K5), the coloring is impossible.

4.  **Search for a K5:** Let's test potential K5s. Vertices 1 and 6 have the highest degree (7).
    *   Consider {0, 1, 2, 6, 7}. We need to check if all pairs are connected.
        *   (0,1), (0,2), (0,6), (0,7) - Yes
        *   (1,2), (1,6), (1,7) - Yes
        *   (2,6), (2,7) - Yes
        *   (6,7)? Checking the edge list, there is *no* edge between 6 and 7. So, {0, 1, 2, 6, 7} is not a K5.

5.  **Search for K4s:** Let's find cliques of size 4.
    *   Consider {0, 1, 2, 6}. Edges: (0,1), (0,2), (0,6), (1,2), (1,6), (2,6). All pairs are connected. This is a K4.
    *   This means vertices 0, 1, 2, and 6 must all have different colors in any valid coloring. Let's assign them 4 distinct colors:
        *   Color(0) = C1
        *   Color(1) = C2
        *   Color(2) = C3
        *   Color(6) = C4

6.  **Analyze Vertex 7:** Now consider vertex 7. Its neighbors are N(7) = {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6}.
    *   Vertex 7 is adjacent to vertex 0, so Color(7) must be different from Color(0) = C1.
    *   Vertex 7 is adjacent to vertex 1, so Color(7) must be different from Color(1) = C2.
    *   Vertex 7 is adjacent to vertex 2, so Color(7) must be different from Color(2) = C3.
    *   Vertex 7 is adjacent to vertex 6, so Color(7) must be different from Color(6) = C4.

7.  **Conclusion:** Vertex 7 must have a color different from C1, C2, C3, and C4. However, we only have these four colors available (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow). There is no fifth color to assign to vertex 7 that satisfies the condition that it must be different from the colors of its neighbors 0, 1, 2, and 6.

8.  **Final Result:** Therefore, it is impossible to color this graph with only 4 colors.
