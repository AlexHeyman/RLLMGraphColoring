To determine if the graph can be colored with four colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow) such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color, we need to check if the graph is 4-colorable.

Let the set of colors be C = {Red, Green, Blue, Yellow}.

A common reason a graph might not be k-colorable is if it contains a (k+1)-clique (a complete subgraph with k+1 vertices). In our case, we are checking for 4-colorability, so we should look for a 5-clique (K5). A K5 requires 5 distinct colors.

Let's examine the neighborhood of vertices with high degrees.
Vertex 7 has neighbors N(7) = {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6}.
Vertex 0 has neighbors N(0) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7}.
Vertex 1 has neighbors N(1) = {0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7}.
Vertex 3 has neighbors N(3) = {0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7}.
Vertex 6 has neighbors N(6) = {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7}.
Vertex 5 has neighbors N(5) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7}.

Consider the set of vertices {0, 1, 3, 6, 7}. Let's check if they form a K5. We need to verify if every pair of vertices in this set is connected by an edge.
Edges involving 0: (0,1), (0,3), (0,6), (0,7). All exist in the edge list.
Edges involving 1: (1,0), (1,3), (1,6), (1,7). All exist in the edge list.
Edges involving 3: (3,0), (3,1), (3,6), (3,7). All exist in the edge list.
Edges involving 6: (6,0), (6,1), (6,3), (6,7). Edges (0,6), (1,6), (3,6) exist. Does (6,7) exist? Checking the edge list: {(0,1), ..., (5,6), (5,7)}. The edge (6,7) is *not* in the list.
Therefore, {0, 1, 3, 6, 7} is not a K5.

Let's try a different approach. Consider vertex 7 and its neighbors N(7) = {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6}. If we can color the graph with 4 colors, then vertex 7 must receive one color, say C1. All its neighbors in N(7) must have colors different from C1. Can the subgraph induced by N(7) be colored with the remaining 3 colors (C2, C3, C4)?

Let's examine the subgraph G' induced by N(7) = {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6}. The edges in G' are the edges from the original list where both endpoints are in N(7):
{(0,1), (0,3), (0,4), (0,6), (1,3), (1,5), (1,6), (3,5), (3,6), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6)}

Does G' contain a K4? Consider the subset {0, 1, 3, 6}.
Edges: (0,1), (0,3), (0,6), (1,3), (1,6), (3,6). All these edges exist in G'.
So, {0, 1, 3, 6} forms a K4 within G'.

Any valid coloring of G' must assign 4 distinct colors to the vertices {0, 1, 3, 6}. Let these colors be C_R, C_G, C_B, C_Y.
Color(0) = Red
Color(1) = Green
Color(3) = Blue
Color(6) = Yellow

Now consider the remaining vertices in G': {4, 5}.
Vertex 4 is adjacent to {0, 6}. Color(4) must be != Color(0)=Red and != Color(6)=Yellow. So Color(4) can be Green or Blue.
Vertex 5 is adjacent to {1, 3, 6}. Color(5) must be != Color(1)=Green, != Color(3)=Blue, != Color(6)=Yellow. So Color(5) must be Red.

We also need to check the edge (4,5). Color(4) must be != Color(5).
If Color(4) = Green, then Color(4) != Color(5)=Red. This is possible.
If Color(4) = Blue, then Color(4) != Color(5)=Red. This is possible.

Let's choose Color(4) = Green.
The coloring for N(7) = {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6} is:
0: Red
1: Green
3: Blue
4: Green
5: Red
6: Yellow

Let's check all edges within G' for this coloring:
(0,1) R!=G OK
(0,3) R!=B OK
(0,4) R!=G OK
(0,6) R!=Y OK
(1,3) G!=B OK
(1,5) G!=R OK
(1,6) G!=Y OK
(3,5) B!=R OK
(3,6) B!=Y OK
(4,5) G!=R OK
(4,6) G!=Y OK
(5,6) R!=Y OK
However, we have adjacent vertices 1 and 4 both colored Green. The edge (1,4) is not in the list, so this is not a problem based on the edges *within G'*. But wait, vertex 4 is adjacent to 0 and 6. Vertex 1 is adjacent to 0, 3, 5, 6. Let's re-evaluate.

The vertices {0, 1, 3, 6} form a K4, so they must have 4 distinct colors. Let's use R, G, B, Y.
0: R
1: G
3: B
6: Y

Vertex 5 is adjacent to 1(G), 3(B), 6(Y). Color(5) must be R.
Vertex 4 is adjacent to 0(R), 6(Y). Color(4) must be G or B.
Vertex 4 is also adjacent to 5(R). This doesn't add constraints (G!=R, B!=R).
Vertex 4 is also adjacent to 7 (outside this subgraph).

So, the neighbors of 7, N(7) = {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6}, require the following colors:
0: R
1: G
3: B
6: Y
5: R
4: G or B

In either case (Color(4)=G or Color(4)=B), the set of colors used for N(7) is {R, G, B, Y}. All four colors are used by the neighbors of vertex 7.

Since vertex 7 is adjacent to all vertices in N(7), the color of vertex 7 must be different from all the colors used by its neighbors. That is, Color(7) must be different from R, G, B, and Y.
This requires a fifth color.

Therefore, the graph cannot be colored using only four colors.
