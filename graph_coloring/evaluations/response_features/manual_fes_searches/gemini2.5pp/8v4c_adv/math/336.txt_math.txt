``` V = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
E = {(0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,4), (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,6), (5,7)}
Colors = {Red, Green, Blue, Yellow} (4 colors)

We need to determine if this graph G = (V, E) is 4-colorable.

First, let's look for cliques (subsets of vertices where every two distinct vertices are adjacent). The size of the largest clique (clique number, ω(G)) is a lower bound for the chromatic number χ(G). If ω(G) > 4, then the graph is not 4-colorable.

Consider the subset of vertices {0, 1, 2, 3}.
Edges between these vertices:
(0,1) - Yes
(0,2) - Yes
(0,3) - Yes
(1,2) - Yes
(1,3) - Yes
(2,3) - Yes
This forms a K4 clique. This means we need at least 4 colors (ω(G) ≥ 4). Since we have 4 colors available, this doesn't immediately rule out a 4-coloring.

Let's try to assign colors. Since {0, 1, 2, 3} form a K4, they must receive 4 distinct colors. Let's assign:
0: Red
1: Green
2: Blue
3: Yellow

Now, let's try to color the remaining vertices (4, 5, 6, 7).

Vertex 4:
Neighbors of 4 are {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7}.
Colored neighbors are {1(Green), 2(Blue), 3(Yellow)}.
The colors used by neighbors are Green, Blue, Yellow.
The available color for 4 is Red.
Assign 4: Red.
Check consistency: Is 4 adjacent to 0 (Red)? The edge (0,4) is not in the edge list. So, this assignment is valid so far.

Vertex 5:
Neighbors of 5 are {0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7}.
Colored neighbors are {0(Red), 1(Green), 2(Blue), 4(Red)}.
The distinct colors used by neighbors are Red, Green, Blue.
The available color for 5 is Yellow.
Assign 5: Yellow.
Check consistency: Is 5 adjacent to 3 (Yellow)? The edge (3,5) is not in the edge list. So, this assignment is valid so far.

Vertex 6:
Neighbors of 6 are {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7}.
Colored neighbors are {0(Red), 1(Green), 3(Yellow), 4(Red), 5(Yellow)}.
The distinct colors used by neighbors are Red, Green, Yellow.
The available color for 6 is Blue.
Assign 6: Blue.
Check consistency: Is 6 adjacent to 2 (Blue)? The edge (2,6) is not in the edge list. So, this assignment is valid so far.

Vertex 7:
Neighbors of 7 are {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6}.
Colored neighbors are:
0: Red
1: Green
3: Yellow
4: Red
5: Yellow
6: Blue
The distinct colors used by the neighbors of 7 are {Red, Green, Yellow, Blue}.
All 4 available colors are used by the neighbors of vertex 7. Therefore, there is no color available for vertex 7 that satisfies the condition that no two adjacent vertices receive the same color.

This specific attempt failed. Let's re-verify the logic. The assignment of colors to {0, 1, 2, 3} must use four distinct colors. Let these be c1, c2, c3, c4.
Color(0)=c1, Color(1)=c2, Color(2)=c3, Color(3)=c4.
Vertex 4 is adjacent to 1, 2, 3 (colors c2, c3, c4). Vertex 4 is not adjacent to 0. So, Color(4) must be c1.
Vertex 5 is adjacent to 0, 1, 2, 4 (colors c1, c2, c3, c1). Distinct colors are c1, c2, c3. Vertex 5 is not adjacent to 3. So, Color(5) must be c4.
Vertex 6 is adjacent to 0, 1, 3, 4, 5 (colors c1, c2, c4, c1, c4). Distinct colors are c1, c2, c4. Vertex 6 is not adjacent to 2. So, Color(6) must be c3.
Now consider vertex 7. Its neighbors are {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6}. The colors assigned to these neighbors are {c1, c2, c4, c1, c4, c3}. The set of distinct colors is {c1, c2, c3, c4}. All four colors are used by the neighbors of 7.
Since this holds regardless of which specific colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow) are assigned to c1, c2, c3, c4, it proves that vertex 7 cannot be colored using only four colors if its neighbors are colored according to the constraints imposed by the K4 clique {0,1,2,3} and the non-adjacencies.

Therefore, the graph cannot be colored with 4 colors.
