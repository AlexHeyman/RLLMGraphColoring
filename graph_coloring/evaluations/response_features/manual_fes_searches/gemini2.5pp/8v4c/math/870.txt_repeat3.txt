To determine if the graph can be colored with 4 colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow) such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color, we need to check if the graph is 4-colorable.

The vertices are V = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}.
The edges are E = {(0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,5), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (2,4), (2,6), (2,7), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,7), (5,7)}.

Let's list the neighbors for each vertex:
N(0): {1, 2, 3, 5}
N(1): {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
N(2): {0, 1, 4, 6, 7}
N(3): {0, 1, 4, 5, 6}
N(4): {1, 2, 3, 7}
N(5): {0, 1, 3, 7}
N(6): {1, 2, 3}
N(7): {1, 2, 4, 5}

A graph requires at least k colors if it contains a clique of size k (a subgraph where every pair of vertices is connected by an edge). Let's look for cliques.

Consider the set {0, 1, 3, 5}.
Edges: (0,1), (0,3), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5), (3,5). All pairs are connected. This is a clique of size 4 (K4).
This means we need at least 4 colors.

Consider the set {1, 2, 4, 7}.
Edges: (1,2), (1,4), (1,7), (2,4), (2,7), (4,7). All pairs are connected. This is also a clique of size 4 (K4).
This also implies we need at least 4 colors.

The question is whether 4 colors are sufficient. Let's try to assign colors (C1=Red, C2=Green, C3=Blue, C4=Yellow).

Let's color the first clique {0, 1, 3, 5}:
0: Red (C1)
1: Green (C2)
3: Blue (C3)
5: Yellow (C4)

Now, let's try to color the remaining vertices {2, 4, 6, 7}.

Vertex 2: Neighbors are {0, 1, 4, 6, 7}.
Colored neighbors: 0 (Red), 1 (Green).
Available colors for 2: {Blue, Yellow}.

Vertex 4: Neighbors are {1, 2, 3, 7}.
Colored neighbors: 1 (Green), 3 (Blue).
Available colors for 4: {Red, Yellow}.

Vertex 6: Neighbors are {1, 2, 3}.
Colored neighbors: 1 (Green), 3 (Blue).
Available colors for 6: {Red, Yellow}.

Vertex 7: Neighbors are {1, 2, 4, 5}.
Colored neighbors: 1 (Green), 5 (Yellow).
Available colors for 7: {Red, Blue}.

Now we need to make consistent choices for {2, 4, 6, 7}.

Case 1: Assign Color to Vertex 2. Let 2 = Blue.
Check for conflicts: Is 2 adjacent to 3 (Blue)? No. Okay.
Now update constraints based on 2=Blue:
Vertex 4: Neighbors {1(G), 2(B), 3(B), 7(?)}. Vertex 4 is adjacent to both 2 and 3, which are assigned Blue. This is impossible.
So, Vertex 2 cannot be Blue.

Case 2: Assign Color to Vertex 2. Vertex 2 must be Yellow.
Check for conflicts: Is 2 adjacent to 5 (Yellow)? No. Okay.
2: Yellow (C4)
Now update constraints based on 2=Yellow:
Vertex 4: Neighbors {1(G), 2(Y), 3(B), 7(?)}. Colors used by neighbors {G, Y, B}. The only available color for 4 is Red.
4: Red (C1)
Check for conflicts: Is 4 adjacent to 0 (Red)? No. Okay.
Vertex 6: Neighbors {1(G), 2(Y), 3(B)}. Colors used by neighbors {G, Y, B}. The only available color for 6 is Red.
6: Red (C1)
Check for conflicts: Is 6 adjacent to 0 (Red)? No. Is 6 adjacent to 4 (Red)? No. Okay.
Vertex 7: Neighbors {1(G), 2(Y), 4(R), 5(Y)}. Vertex 7 is adjacent to both 2 and 5, which are assigned Yellow. This is impossible.

Both possible color choices for vertex 2 lead to a contradiction. This means that starting with the coloring of the clique {0, 1, 3, 5}, we cannot extend it to a valid 4-coloring of the entire graph.

Since we proved that any attempt to 4-color this graph must fail, the graph is not 4-colorable.

Impossible
