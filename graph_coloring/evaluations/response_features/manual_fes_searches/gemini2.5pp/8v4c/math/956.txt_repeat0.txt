**Analysis:**

1.  **Identify the Graph:** We have a graph G = (V, E) where V = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} and E = {(0,2), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,2), (1,3), (1,5), (1,6), (2,3), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,4), (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,7)}.
2.  **Coloring Requirement:** We need to assign one of four colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow) to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. This is a graph 4-coloring problem.
3.  **Chromatic Number and Cliques:** A key property of graph coloring is that the chromatic number χ(G) (the minimum number of colors needed) must be at least as large as the size of the largest clique ω(G) (a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are adjacent). If we can find a clique of size 5 or more, then 4-coloring is impossible.
4.  **Search for a Clique:** Let's examine subsets of vertices to see if they form a clique.
    *   Consider the vertex 6. Its neighbors are N(6) = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7}.
    *   Consider the vertex 2. Its neighbors are N(2) = {0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7}.
    *   Consider the vertex 5. Its neighbors are N(5) = {0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7}.
    *   Consider the vertex 7. Its neighbors are N(7) = {0, 2, 3, 5, 6}.
    *   Consider the vertex 0. Its neighbors are N(0) = {2, 4, 5, 6, 7}.

    Let's test the subset {0, 2, 5, 6, 7}. We need to check if every pair of vertices in this subset has an edge between them.
    *   Edges involving 0: (0,2), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7) - All exist in E.
    *   Edges involving 2 (excluding 0): (2,5), (2,6), (2,7) - All exist in E.
    *   Edges involving 5 (excluding 0, 2): (5,6), (5,7) - Both exist in E.
    *   Edge involving 6 (excluding 0, 2, 5): (6,7) - This exists in E (since 7 is a neighbor of 6).

    Since all 10 pairs of vertices within the set {0, 2, 5, 6, 7} are connected by an edge, this subset forms a clique of size 5 (K5).
5.  **Conclusion:** Because the graph contains a clique of size 5, any valid coloring requires at least 5 distinct colors. We only have 4 colors available (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow). Therefore, it is impossible to color the graph according to the rules.
