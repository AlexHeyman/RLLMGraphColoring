Let's analyze the graph structure. We need to determine if the graph is 4-colorable.

The vertices are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}.
The edges are {(0,1), (0,2), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (2,4), (2,6), (2,7), (3,4), (4,7), (5,6), (5,7)}.

A key property related to graph coloring is the presence of cliques. A clique is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices in the clique are adjacent. If a graph contains a clique of size k (a k-clique), then at least k colors are required to color the graph.

Let's examine the subset of vertices {0, 1, 5, 6, 7}. We need to check if every pair of vertices in this subset is connected by an edge.
- Edges involving 0: (0,1), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7) - All present.
- Edges involving 1: (1,0), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7) - All present.
- Edges involving 5: (5,0), (5,1), (5,6), (5,7) - All present.
- Edges involving 6: (6,0), (6,1), (6,5), (6,7)? Let's check the list. (0,6), (1,6), (5,6) are present. Is (6,7) present? Yes, vertex 7 is adjacent to 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6. So (6,7) exists. All edges involving 6 within the subset are present.
- Edges involving 7: (7,0), (7,1), (7,5), (7,6) - All present (as confirmed above).

Since every pair of vertices in the set {0, 1, 5, 6, 7} is connected by an edge, this subset forms a clique of size 5.

To color a graph, any two adjacent vertices must have different colors. In a clique of size 5, all 5 vertices are mutually adjacent. Therefore, all 5 vertices in the clique {0, 1, 5, 6, 7} must receive different colors.

We are only allowed to use 4 colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow). Since we need at least 5 distinct colors to color the vertices in the 5-clique, it is impossible to color this graph using only 4 colors.

Impossible
