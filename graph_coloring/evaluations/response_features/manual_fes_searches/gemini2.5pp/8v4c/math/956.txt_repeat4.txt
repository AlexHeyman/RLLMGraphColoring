Let's analyze the graph structure.
Vertices: V = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
Edges: E = {(0,2), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,2), (1,3), (1,5), (1,6), (2,3), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,4), (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,7)}

We need to determine if this graph can be colored using 4 colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow) such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.

A key concept in graph coloring is the clique number, ω(G), which is the size of the largest clique (a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are adjacent) in the graph G. The chromatic number, χ(G), which is the minimum number of colors needed for a valid coloring, must be greater than or equal to the clique number (χ(G) ≥ ω(G)). If we can find a clique of size 5 or larger, then a 4-coloring is impossible.

Let's examine the adjacencies for a subset of vertices. Consider the set of vertices {0, 2, 5, 6, 7}. Let's check if they form a clique by verifying if every pair of vertices in this set has an edge between them:
- (0,2): Yes
- (0,5): Yes
- (0,6): Yes
- (0,7): Yes
- (2,5): Yes
- (2,6): Yes
- (2,7): Yes
- (5,6): Yes
- (5,7): Yes
- (6,7): Yes (This edge is implicitly present as (5,7) and (5,6) are listed, but let's check the original list. Ah, (5,7) is listed, and (5,6) is listed. We need to check (6,7). Let's look at the neighbors of 6: N(6) = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7}. Yes, 7 is a neighbor of 6, so the edge (6,7) exists.)

All pairs of vertices in the set {0, 2, 5, 6, 7} are connected by an edge. This means that these 5 vertices form a clique of size 5 (K5).

Since the graph contains a clique of size 5, any valid coloring requires at least 5 distinct colors. We only have 4 colors available (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow). Therefore, it is impossible to color this graph according to the rules.

Impossible
