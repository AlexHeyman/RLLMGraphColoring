To determine if the 8 people can wear shirts of 4 different colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow) such that no two friends wear the same color, we can model this problem using graph coloring. Let the 8 people be the vertices of a graph G, and let an edge connect two vertices if the corresponding people are friends. We want to know if this graph G is 4-colorable.

The people are V = {Alice (A), Bob (B), Carol (C), Dave (D), Ethan (E), Fran (F), George (G), Heather (H)}.
The friendships define the edges E of the graph G:
A is friends with B, C, D, F. Edges: (A, B), (A, C), (A, D), (A, F).
B is friends with A, C, F, H. Edges: (B, C), (B, F), (B, H).
C is friends with A, B, F, G. Edges: (C, F), (C, G).
D is friends with A, E, G. Edges: (D, E), (D, G).
E is friends with D, F, G, H. Edges: (E, F), (E, G), (E, H).
F is friends with A, B, C, E, H. Edges: (F, H).
G is friends with C, D, E, H. Edges: (G, H).
H is friends with B, E, F, G.

The adjacency list for the graph G is:
A: B, C, D, F
B: A, C, F, H
C: A, B, F, G
D: A, E, G
E: D, F, G, H
F: A, B, C, E, H
G: C, D, E, H
H: B, E, F, G

A clique in a graph is a subset of vertices where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge. If a graph contains a clique of size k, then at least k colors are needed to color the graph (χ(G) >= k).
Let's examine the vertices A, B, C, F:
A is friends with B, C, F.
B is friends with A, C, F.
C is friends with A, B, F.
F is friends with A, B, C.
So, {A, B, C, F} forms a clique of size 4 (K4). This means we need at least 4 colors to color the graph. Since we have exactly 4 colors available (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow), it might be possible.

Let's try to color the graph with 4 colors, say 1, 2, 3, 4. We can use backtracking search.
First, assign colors to the clique {A, B, C, F}. They must all have different colors.
Let A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, F = 4.

Now we try to color the remaining vertices D, E, G, H.
Vertex E is friends with D, F, G, H. F has color 4. So E cannot be color 4. E can be 1, 2, or 3.
Let's explore the possible colors for E:

Case 1: E = 1.
  G is friends with C(3), D(?), E(1), H(?). G cannot be 1 or 3. G can be 2 or 4.
  Case 1.1: G = 2.
    H is friends with B(2), E(1), F(4), G(2). H cannot be 1, 2, 4. H must be 3.
    D is friends with A(1), E(1), G(2). D cannot be 1 or 2. D can be 3 or 4.
    Case 1.1.1: D = 3. Coloring: A=1, B=2, C=3, F=4, E=1, G=2, H=3, D=3.
      Check validity: G(2) is friends with C(3), D(3), E(1), H(3). Neighbors C, D, H have color 3. Invalid. D and H must have different colors than G, but D and H have the same color 3. G is friends with D and H? Yes. This is not the issue. The issue is G's neighbors D and H have the same color 3. Are D and H friends? No. Is G friends with D and H? Yes. G(2) friends D(3), H(3). This is okay. Let's check D(3). D is friends with A(1), E(1), G(2). Neighbors A and E have color 1. Invalid. A and E must have different colors.
    Case 1.1.2: D = 4. Coloring: A=1, B=2, C=3, F=4, E=1, G=2, H=3, D=4.
      Check validity: D(4) is friends with A(1), E(1), G(2). Neighbors A and E have color 1. Invalid. A and E must have different colors.
  Case 1.2: G = 4.
    H is friends with B(2), E(1), F(4), G(4). H cannot be 1, 2, 4. H must be 3.
    D is friends with A(1), E(1), G(4). D cannot be 1 or 4. D can be 2 or 3.
    Case 1.2.1: D = 2. Coloring: A=1, B=2, C=3, F=4, E=1, G=4, H=3, D=2.
      Check validity: D(2) is friends with A(1), E(1), G(4). Neighbors A and E have color 1. Invalid.
    Case 1.2.2: D = 3. Coloring: A=1, B=2, C=3, F=4, E=1, G=4, H=3, D=3.
      Check validity: D(3) is friends with A(1), E(1), G(4). Neighbors A and E have color 1. Invalid.
Since all subcases for E=1 lead to contradictions where A and E must have different colors, but A=1 and E=1. Let's re-check D's neighbors. D: A, E, G. Yes, D is friends with A and E. So A and E must have different colors. This means E cannot be 1 (since A=1).

Case 2: E = 2.
  G is friends with C(3), D(?), E(2), H(?). G cannot be 2 or 3. G can be 1 or 4.
  Case 2.1: G = 1.
    H is friends with B(2), E(2), F(4), G(1). H cannot be 1, 2, 4. H must be 3.
    D is friends with A(1), E(2), G(1). D cannot be 1 or 2. D can be 3 or 4.
    Case 2.1.1: D = 3. Coloring: A=1, B=2, C=3, F=4, E=2, G=1, H=3, D=3.
      Check validity: C(3) is friends with A(1), B(2), F(4), G(1). OK. G(1) is friends with C(3), D(3), E(2), H(3). Neighbors C, D, H have color 3. Invalid. C, D, H must have different colors from G(1). But C, D, H are not necessarily friends with each other. G is friends with C(3), D(3), E(2), H(3). This is okay for G. Let's check C(3). C is friends with A(1), B(2), F(4), G(1). OK. Let's check D(3). D is friends with A(1), E(2), G(1). OK. Let's check H(3). H is friends with B(2), E(2), F(4), G(1). Neighbors B and E have color 2. Invalid. B and E must have different colors.
    Case 2.1.2: D = 4. Coloring: A=1, B=2, C=3, F=4, E=2, G=1, H=3, D=4.
      Check validity: H(3) is friends with B(2), E(2), F(4), G(1). Neighbors B and E have color 2. Invalid.
  Case 2.2: G = 4.
    H is friends with B(2), E(2), F(4), G(4). H cannot be 2 or 4. H can be 1 or 3.
    Case 2.2.1: H = 1.
      D is friends with A(1), E(2), G(4). D cannot be 1, 2, 4. D must be 3.
      Coloring: A=1, B=2, C=3, F=4, E=2, G=4, H=1, D=3.
      Check validity: H(1) is friends with B(2), E(2), F(4), G(4). Neighbors E and B have color 2. Invalid. Neighbors F and G have color 4. Invalid.
    Case 2.2.2: H = 3.
      D is friends with A(1), E(2), G(4). D cannot be 1, 2, 4. D must be 3.
      Coloring: A=1, B=2, C=3, F=4, E=2, G=4, H=3, D=3.
      Check validity: H(3) is friends with B(2), E(2), F(4), G(4). Neighbors B and E have color 2. Invalid. Neighbors F and G have color 4. Invalid.
Since all subcases for E=2 lead to contradictions.

Case 3: E = 3.
  G is friends with C(3), D(?), E(3), H(?). G cannot be 3. G can be 1, 2, 4.
  Case 3.1: G = 1.
    H is friends with B(2), E(3), F(4), G(1). H cannot be 1, 2, 3, 4. H cannot be colored. Invalid.
  Case 3.2: G = 2.
    H is friends with B(2), E(3), F(4), G(2). H cannot be 2, 3, 4. H must be 1.
    D is friends with A(1), E(3), G(2). D cannot be 1, 2, 3. D must be 4.
    Coloring: A=1, B=2, C=3, F=4, E=3, G=2, H=1, D=4.
    Check validity: A(1) is friends with B(2), C(3), D(4), F(4). Neighbors D and F have color 4. Invalid.
  Case 3.3: G = 4.
    H is friends with B(2), E(3), F(4), G(4). H cannot be 2, 3, 4. H must be 1.
    D is friends with A(1), E(3), G(4). D cannot be 1, 3, 4. D must be 2.
    Coloring: A=1, B=2, C=3, F=4, E=3, G=4, H=1, D=2.
    Check validity: B(2) is friends with A(1), C(3), F(4), H(1). OK. D(2) is friends with A(1), E(3), G(4). OK. G(4) is friends with C(3), D(2), E(3), H(1). Neighbors C and E have color 3. Invalid.

All possible cases for assigning colors have led to a contradiction. This means it is impossible to assign colors according to the rules. The graph G is not 4-colorable.

The people are V = {#0 (A), #1 (B), #2 (C), #3 (D), #4 (E), #5 (F), #6 (G), #7 (H)}.
The friendships define the edges E of the graph G:
A is friends with B, C, D, F. Edges: (A, B), (A, C), (A, D), (A, F).
B is friends with A, C, F, H. Edges: (B, C), (B, F), (B, H).

A clique in a graph is a subset of vertices where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge. If a graph contains a clique of size k, then at least k colors are needed to color the graph (χ(G) >= k).
Let's examine the vertices A, B, C, F:
A is friends with B, C, F.
B is friends with A, C, F.
C is friends with A, B, F.
F is friends with A, B, C.
So, {A, B, C, F} forms a clique of size 4 (K4). This means we need at least 4 colors to color the graph. Since we have exactly 4 colors available (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow), it might be possible.

Now we try to color the remaining vertices D, E, G, H.
