Let the 8 people be the vertices of a graph G = (V, E), where V = {Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather}. Let an edge (u, v) exist in E if person u and person v are friends. We are given 4 colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow) and we want to assign a color to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. This is a graph coloring problem where we need to determine if the graph G is 4-colorable.

First, let's list the friendships (edges) for each person (vertex):
Alice (A): D, E, F, G, H
Bob (B): C, D, E, G, H
Carol (C): B, D, G, H
Dave (D): A, B, C, E, G, H
Ethan (E): A, B, D, G, H
Fran (F): A, G, H
George (G): A, B, C, D, E, F, H
Heather (H): A, B, C, D, E, F, G

A graph G requires at least k colors if it contains a clique of size k (a subgraph Kk where all pairs of vertices are connected by an edge). We need to check if G contains a clique of size 5 (K5), because if it does, it would require at least 5 colors, making a 4-coloring impossible.

Let's examine the subset of vertices {Alice, Dave, Ethan, George, Heather}. Let's check if they form a K5 clique:
1.  Alice's friends include D, E, G, H. So Alice is connected to D, E, G, H.
2.  Dave's friends include A, C, E, G, H. So Dave is connected to A, E, G, H. (Dave is also friends with B and C).
3.  Ethan's friends include A, B, D, G, H. So Ethan is connected to A, D, G, H. (Ethan is also friends with B).
4.  George's friends include A, B, C, D, E, F, H. So George is connected to A, D, E, H. (George is also friends with B, C, F).
5.  Heather's friends include A, B, C, D, E, F, G. So Heather is connected to A, D, E, G. (Heather is also friends with B, C, F).

Let's verify all the pairs within the set {A, D, E, G, H}:
- A is friends with D, E, G, H. (4 edges: AD, AE, AG, AH) - Confirmed.
- D is friends with A, E, G, H. (Need to check DE, DG, DH) Dave's friends list includes A, B, C, E, G, H. So D is friends with E, G, H. - Confirmed.
- E is friends with A, D, G, H. (Need to check EG, EH) Ethan's friends list includes A, B, D, G, H. So E is friends with G, H. - Confirmed.
- G is friends with A, D, E, H. (Need to check GH) George's friends list includes A, B, C, D, E, F, H. So G is friends with H. - Confirmed.
- H is friends with A, D, E, G. (All checks covered by symmetry G-H) Heather's friends list includes A, B, C, D, E, F, G. So H is friends with G. - Confirmed.

All pairs of vertices in the set {Alice, Dave, Ethan, George, Heather} are connected by an edge. This means that this set of 5 people forms a K5 clique in the friendship graph.

In any valid coloring of a graph, all vertices in a clique must be assigned different colors. Since there is a clique of size 5, we need at least 5 distinct colors to color the graph G.
However, we only have 4 colors available (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow).
Therefore, it is impossible to assign a shirt color to each person such that no two friends wear the same color shirt.

Let the 8 people be the vertices of a graph G = (V, E), where V = {#0, #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7}. Let an edge (u, v) exist in E if person u and person v are friends. We are given 4 colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow) and we want to assign a color to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. This is a graph coloring problem where we need to determine if the graph G is 4-colorable.

2.  #3's friends include A, C, E, G, H. So #3 is connected to A, E, G, H. (#3 is also friends with B and C).
3.  #4's friends include A, B, D, G, H. So #4 is connected to A, D, G, H. (#4 is also friends with B).
4.  #6's friends include A, B, C, D, E, F, H. So #6 is connected to A, D, E, H. (#6 is also friends with B, C, F).
5.  #7's friends include A, B, C, D, E, F, G. So #7 is connected to A, D, E, G. (#7 is also friends with B, C, F).

Let's verify all the pairs within the set {A, D, E, G, H}:
- A is friends with D, E, G, H. (4 edges: AD, AE, AG, AH) - Confirmed.
- D is friends with A, E, G, H. (Need to check DE, DG, DH) #3's friends list includes A, B, C, E, G, H. So D is friends with E, G, H. - Confirmed.
- E is friends with A, D, G, H. (Need to check EG, EH) #4's friends list includes A, B, D, G, H. So E is friends with G, H. - Confirmed.
- G is friends with A, D, E, H. (Need to check GH) #6's friends list includes A, B, C, D, E, F, H. So G is friends with H. - Confirmed.
- H is friends with A, D, E, G. (All checks covered by symmetry G-H) #7's friends list includes A, B, C, D, E, F, G. So H is friends with G. - Confirmed.
