Let the 8 people be represented by the vertices of a graph G = (V, E), where V = {Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather}. An edge exists between two vertices if the corresponding people are friends. The set of available shirt colors is {Red, Green, Blue, Yellow}. We need to assign a color to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. This is a graph coloring problem, and we need to determine if the graph G is 4-colorable.

Let's denote the vertices by their first letters: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H.
The friendships define the edges of the graph:
A is friends with E, F, G. Edges: (A, E), (A, F), (A, G).
B is friends with D, F, G, H. Edges: (B, D), (B, F), (B, G), (B, H).
C is friends with D, E, G, H. Edges: (C, D), (C, E), (C, G), (C, H).
D is friends with E, F, G, H. From B and C's lists, D is also friends with B and C. Edges: (D, E), (D, F), (D, G), (D, H), (D, B), (D, C).
E is friends with F, G. From A, C, D's lists, E is also friends with A, C, D. Edges: (E, F), (E, G), (E, A), (E, C), (E, D).
F is friends with G. From A, B, D, E's lists, F is also friends with A, B, D, E. Edges: (F, G), (F, A), (F, B), (F, D), (F, E).
G is friends with H. From A, B, C, D, E, F's lists, G is also friends with A, B, C, D, E, F. Edges: (G, H), (G, A), (G, B), (G, C), (G, D), (G, E), (G, F).
H has friends B, C, D, G based on the lists of B, C, D, G.

The adjacency list for the graph G is:
A: E, F, G
B: D, F, G, H
C: D, E, G, H
D: B, C, E, F, G, H
E: A, C, D, F, G
F: A, B, D, E, G
G: A, B, C, D, E, F, H
H: B, C, D, G

We need to determine if this graph G is 4-colorable. Let the four colors be c1, c2, c3, c4.

Consider vertex H. Its neighbors are B, C, D, G. In any valid coloring, the color assigned to H, C(H), must be different from the colors assigned to its neighbors: C(B), C(C), C(D), C(G).
For H to be colorable using one of the four available colors, the set of colors {C(B), C(C), C(D), C(G)} must use at most 3 distinct colors. This implies that at least two vertices among B, C, D, G must share the same color.

Let's examine the subgraph induced by the vertices {B, C, D, G}. The edges within this set are:
(B, D), (B, G)
(C, D), (C, G)
(D, G)
The vertices B and C are not friends (there is no edge (B, C)).
Since D is connected to B, C, G, its color C(D) must be different from C(B), C(C), C(G).
Since G is connected to B, C, D, its color C(G) must be different from C(B), C(C), C(D).
Since B is connected to D, G, its color C(B) must be different from C(D), C(G).
Since C is connected to D, G, its color C(C) must be different from C(D), C(G).
Also, D and G are connected, so C(D) != C(G).
B and D are connected, so C(B) != C(D).
B and G are connected, so C(B) != C(G).
C and D are connected, so C(C) != C(D).
C and G are connected, so C(C) != C(G).

The only pair of vertices in {B, C, D, G} that are not connected by an edge is (B, C). Therefore, if any two vertices in this set are to share a color, it must be B and C.
So, for H to be colorable, it must be the case that C(B) = C(C). Let this color be c3.
Since D is adjacent to B and C (both colored c3), C(D) must be different from c3. Let C(D) = c1.
Since G is adjacent to B and C (both colored c3), C(G) must be different from c3. Let C(G) = c2.
Since D and G are adjacent, c1 != c2.
Since D is adjacent to B and C (color c3), c1 != c3.
Since G is adjacent to B and C (color c3), c2 != c3.
Thus, c1, c2, and c3 must be three distinct colors.

Now, consider H. H is adjacent to B(c3), C(c3), D(c1), G(c2). C(H) must be different from c1, c2, c3. Since there are four colors available, H must be assigned the fourth color, c4. C(H) = c4.
So, any valid 4-coloring of G must satisfy: C(D)=c1, C(G)=c2, C(B)=C(C)=c3, C(H)=c4, where c1, c2, c3, c4 are the four distinct colors.

Now let's consider vertex E. E is adjacent to A, C, D, F, G.
The colors of its neighbors C, D, G are C(C)=c3, C(D)=c1, C(G)=c2.
So, C(E) must be different from c1, c2, c3. Therefore, C(E) must be c4 (or possibly a color shared with A or F, but it must be different from c1, c2, c3). The only color available from {c1, c2, c3, c4} is c4. So C(E) = c4.

Now let's consider vertex F. F is adjacent to A, B, D, E, G.
The colors of its neighbors B, D, G are C(B)=c3, C(D)=c1, C(G)=c2.
So, C(F) must be different from c1, c2, c3. Therefore, C(F) must be c4 (or possibly a color shared with A or E, but it must be different from c1, c2, c3). The only color available from {c1, c2, c3, c4} is c4. So C(F) = c4.

We have deduced that in any 4-coloring of G, it must be the case that C(E) = c4 and C(F) = c4.
However, Ethan (E) and Fran (F) are friends. This means there is an edge (E, F) in the graph G.
Adjacent vertices must have different colors, so C(E) must be different from C(F).
But we found that C(E) = c4 and C(F) = c4, which means C(E) = C(F).
This is a contradiction.

The assumption that a valid 4-coloring exists leads to a contradiction. Therefore, the graph G is not 4-colorable. It is impossible to assign shirts to the 8 people according to the given rules.

Let the 8 people be represented by the vertices of a graph G = (V, E), where V = {#0, #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7}. An edge exists between two vertices if the corresponding people are friends. The set of available shirt colors is {Red, Green, Blue, Yellow}. We need to assign a color to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. This is a graph coloring problem, and we need to determine if the graph G is 4-colorable.

Let's denote the vertices by their first letters: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H.

H has friends B, C, D, G based on the lists of B, C, D, G.

The adjacency list for the graph G is:

H: B, C, D, G

We need to determine if this graph G is 4-colorable. Let the four colors be c1, c2, c3, c4.

Consider vertex H. Its neighbors are B, C, D, G. In any valid coloring, the color assigned to H, C(H), must be different from the colors assigned to its neighbors: C(B), C(C), C(D), C(G).

Let's examine the subgraph induced by the vertices {B, C, D, G}. The edges within this set are:
(B, D), (B, G)
(C, D), (C, G)
(D, G)
The vertices B and C are not friends (there is no edge (B, C)).
Since D is connected to B, C, G, its color C(D) must be different from C(B), C(C), C(G).
Since G is connected to B, C, D, its color C(G) must be different from C(B), C(C), C(D).
Since B is connected to D, G, its color C(B) must be different from C(D), C(G).
Since C is connected to D, G, its color C(C) must be different from C(D), C(G).
Also, D and G are connected, so C(D) != C(G).
B and D are connected, so C(B) != C(D).
B and G are connected, so C(B) != C(G).
C and D are connected, so C(C) != C(D).
C and G are connected, so C(C) != C(G).

The only pair of vertices in {B, C, D, G} that are not connected by an edge is (B, C). Therefore, if any two vertices in this set are to share a color, it must be B and C.
So, for H to be colorable, it must be the case that C(B) = C(C). Let this color be c3.
Since D is adjacent to B and C (both colored c3), C(D) must be different from c3. Let C(D) = c1.
Since G is adjacent to B and C (both colored c3), C(G) must be different from c3. Let C(G) = c2.
Since D and G are adjacent, c1 != c2.
Since D is adjacent to B and C (color c3), c1 != c3.
Since G is adjacent to B and C (color c3), c2 != c3.
Thus, c1, c2, and c3 must be three distinct colors.

Now, consider H. H is adjacent to B(c3), C(c3), D(c1), G(c2). C(H) must be different from c1, c2, c3. Since there are four colors available, H must be assigned the fourth color, c4. C(H) = c4.
So, any valid 4-coloring of G must satisfy: C(D)=c1, C(G)=c2, C(B)=C(C)=c3, C(H)=c4, where c1, c2, c3, c4 are the four distinct colors.

Now let's consider vertex E. E is adjacent to A, C, D, F, G.
The colors of its neighbors C, D, G are C(C)=c3, C(D)=c1, C(G)=c2.
So, C(E) must be different from c1, c2, c3. Therefore, C(E) must be c4 (or possibly a color shared with A or F, but it must be different from c1, c2, c3). The only color available from {c1, c2, c3, c4} is c4. So C(E) = c4.

Now let's consider vertex F. F is adjacent to A, B, D, E, G.
The colors of its neighbors B, D, G are C(B)=c3, C(D)=c1, C(G)=c2.
So, C(F) must be different from c1, c2, c3. Therefore, C(F) must be c4 (or possibly a color shared with A or E, but it must be different from c1, c2, c3). The only color available from {c1, c2, c3, c4} is c4. So C(F) = c4.

We have deduced that in any 4-coloring of G, it must be the case that C(E) = c4 and C(F) = c4.
However, #4 (E) and #5 (F) are friends. This means there is an edge (E, F) in the graph G.
Adjacent vertices must have different colors, so C(E) must be different from C(F).
But we found that C(E) = c4 and C(F) = c4, which means C(E) = C(F).
This is a contradiction.

The assumption that a valid 4-coloring exists leads to a contradiction. Therefore, the graph G is not 4-colorable. It is impossible to assign shirts to the 8 people according to the given rules.
