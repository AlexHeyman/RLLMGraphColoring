Let the 8 people be represented by the vertices of a graph G = (V, E), where V = {Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather}. Let's denote them by their initials: V = {A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H}. An edge exists between two vertices if the corresponding people are friends. The available shirt colors are {Red, Green, Blue, Yellow}. We have k = 4 colors. The problem asks if we can color the vertices of G using at most 4 colors such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. This is equivalent to asking if the chromatic number of the graph G, denoted by χ(G), is less than or equal to 4.

First, let's list the friendships (edges) in the graph:
A is friends with B, C, E, F, G, H. Edges: (A,B), (A,C), (A,E), (A,F), (A,G), (A,H).
B is friends with A, C, D, E, G, H. Edges: (B,A), (B,C), (B,D), (B,E), (B,G), (B,H).
C is friends with A, B, D, E, F, G, H. Edges: (C,A), (C,B), (C,D), (C,E), (C,F), (C,G), (C,H).
D is friends with B, C, E, F, G, H. Edges: (D,B), (D,C), (D,E), (D,F), (D,G), (D,H).
E is friends with A, B, C, D, F. Edges: (E,A), (E,B), (E,C), (E,D), (E,F).
F is friends with A, C, D, E, G, H. Edges: (F,A), (F,C), (F,D), (F,E), (F,G), (F,H).
G is friends with A, B, C, D, F, H. Edges: (G,A), (G,B), (G,C), (G,D), (G,F), (G,H).
H is friends with A, B, C, D, F, G. Edges: (H,A), (H,B), (H,C), (H,D), (H,F), (H,G).

To determine if the graph is 4-colorable, we can look for cliques. A clique is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices in the subset are adjacent (friends). If a graph contains a clique of size k, then at least k colors are needed to color the graph (χ(G) ≥ k).

Let's consider the subset of people {Alice, Carol, Fran, George, Heather}, or {A, C, F, G, H}. Let's check if they form a clique:
- Is A friends with C? Yes.
- Is A friends with F? Yes.
- Is A friends with G? Yes.
- Is A friends with H? Yes.
- Is C friends with F? Yes.
- Is C friends with G? Yes.
- Is C friends with H? Yes.
- Is F friends with G? Yes.
- Is F friends with H? Yes.
- Is G friends with H? Yes.

All pairs of people in the set {A, C, F, G, H} are friends with each other. This means that {A, C, F, G, H} forms a clique of size 5.
Since there is a clique of size 5, any valid coloring of the graph G requires at least 5 distinct colors. Each person in the clique {A, C, F, G, H} must wear a different colored shirt.
However, we only have 4 colors available (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow).
Therefore, it is impossible to assign shirts such that no two friends wear the same color.
