Edges: [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 6), (5, 7)]

Okay, let's analyze the graph and the coloring requirement.

1.  **Identify the vertices and edges:**
    Vertices: V = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
    Edges: E = {(0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,6), (0,7), (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,6), (4,7), (5,6), (5,7)}
    Number of colors available: 4 (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow)

2.  **Look for dense subgraphs (cliques):** A clique is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices in the clique are adjacent. The size of the largest clique (clique number, ω(G)) is a lower bound for the number of colors needed (chromatic number, χ(G)). If we find a clique of size 5 (K5), then we need at least 5 colors, making a 4-coloring impossible.

3.  **Examine the neighborhood of high-degree vertices:** Vertices 2 and 6 have the highest degree (7). Let's examine the connections between vertices related to them.

4.  **Consider the subset of vertices {0, 2, 3, 6, 7}:** Let's check the edges between these 5 vertices using the provided edge list:
    *   Edges involving 0: (0,2), (0,3), (0,6), (0,7) - Yes, all present.
    *   Edges involving 2: (2,0), (2,3), (2,6), (2,7) - Yes, all present.
    *   Edges involving 3: (3,0), (3,2), (3,6), (3,7) - Yes, all present.
    *   Edges involving 6: (6,0), (6,2), (6,3) - Yes. Is (6,7) present? No, (6,7) is *not* in the edge list.
    *   Edges involving 7: (7,0), (7,2), (7,3) - Yes. Is (7,6) present? No.

5.  **Analyze the subgraph induced by {0, 2, 3, 6, 7}:** This subgraph has 5 vertices. All pairs of vertices are connected by an edge *except* for the pair (6, 7). This structure is very close to a K5.

6.  **Attempt to 4-color this subgraph:** Let the four colors be C1, C2, C3, C4.
    *   Assign a color to vertex 0: C(0) = C1.
    *   Assign a color to vertex 2: C(2) = C2 (must be different from C1 as (0,2) is an edge).
    *   Assign a color to vertex 3: C(3) = C3 (must be different from C1 and C2 as (0,3) and (2,3) are edges).
    *   Assign a color to vertex 6: C(6) = C4 (must be different from C1, C2, C3 as (0,6), (2,6), (3,6) are edges).
    *   Now consider vertex 7. It is adjacent to vertices 0, 2, and 3. So, C(7) must be different from C(0)=C1, C(2)=C2, and C(3)=C3. The only available color is C4.
    *   However, vertex 6 was assigned C4. If C(7) is assigned C4, we need to check if 6 and 7 are adjacent. The edge (6, 7) is *not* present in the graph. So, assigning C(7) = C4 seems possible *within this subgraph*.

7.  **Let's re-evaluate the K5 search.** Maybe I missed one.
    Consider {2, 3, 4, 6, 7}?
    Edges: (2,3), (2,4), (2,6), (2,7), (3,4), (3,6), (3,7), (4,6), (4,7). Missing: (6,7). Not K5.
    Consider {1, 2, 4, 5, 6}?
    Edges: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (4,6), (5,6). Missing: (4,5). Not K5.

8.  **Let's reconsider the subgraph {0, 2, 3, 6, 7} and the coloring attempt:**
    C(0) = Red
    C(2) = Green (adjacent to 0)
    C(3) = Blue (adjacent to 0, 2)
    C(6) = Yellow (adjacent to 0, 2, 3)
    C(7) = ?
    Neighbors of 7 in this set are {0, 2, 3}. Their colors are Red, Green, Blue.
    So, C(7) must be Yellow.
    But C(6) is Yellow. Are 6 and 7 adjacent? No. So this coloring {0:R, 2:G, 3:B, 6:Y, 7:Y} is valid *for this subgraph*.

9.  **Let's try the full graph again with the high-degree first order, but be careful at the end.**
    Order: 2, 6, 3, 0, 1, 4, 5, 7
    Colors: R, G, B, Y

    *   Vertex 2: Red
    *   Vertex 6: Green (Neighbor 2=R)
    *   Vertex 3: Blue (Neighbors 2=R, 6=G)
    *   Vertex 0: Yellow (Neighbors 2=R, 3=B, 6=G)
    *   Vertex 1: Blue (Neighbors 0=Y, 2=R, 6=G). Available: B.
    *   Vertex 4: Yellow (Neighbors 1=B, 2=R, 3=B, 6=G). Available: Y.
    *   Vertex 5: Yellow (Neighbors 1=B, 2=R, 3=B, 6=G). Available: Y.
    *   Vertex 7: Neighbors {0(Y), 2(R), 3(B), 4(Y), 5(Y), 6(G)}.
        *   Adjacent colors: Yellow, Red, Blue, Green. All four colors are used by the neighbors of vertex 7.

10. **Conclusion:** Vertex 7 is adjacent to vertices 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. In the specific coloring attempt above, these neighbors received the colors Yellow, Red, Blue, Yellow, Yellow, Green. The set of unique colors used by the neighbors is {Red, Green, Blue, Yellow}. Since vertex 7 is adjacent to vertices assigned all four possible colors, there is no color available for vertex 7. This specific coloring attempt failed.

11. **Does this prove impossibility?** The failure of a greedy algorithm doesn't prove impossibility. However, the structure identified in step 9, where vertex 7's neighbors {0, 2, 3, 6} forced the use of 4 distinct colors in the first attempt (step 10), and neighbors {0, 2, 3, 6} forced the use of 4 distinct colors in the second attempt (step 9, where neighbors 0, 2, 3, 6 got Y, R, B, G), strongly suggests a problem.

12. **Let's focus on {0, 2, 3, 6, 7} again.** We showed it *can* be 4-colored if isolated. But it's part of a larger graph.
    Consider the set {0, 2, 3, 6}. These vertices are all mutually adjacent *except* (0,3) and (2,6)? No, wait.
    Edges: (0,2), (0,3), (0,6), (2,3), (2,6), (3,6). Yes, {0, 2, 3, 6} form a K4. They must have 4 different colors.
    Let C(0)=c1, C(2)=c2, C(3)=c3, C(6)=c4.
    Now consider vertex 7. Neighbors are {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.
    Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 6} have distinct colors c1, c2, c3, c4.
    Since vertex 7 is adjacent to 0, 2, 3, 6, it is adjacent to vertices using all four colors. Therefore, vertex 7 cannot be colored with any of the four available colors.

13. **Final Check:** The vertices {0, 2, 3, 6} form a K4, requiring 4 distinct colors. Vertex 7 is adjacent to all four vertices in this K4 ({0, 2, 3, 6}). Therefore, any valid coloring would require the neighbors of 7 to use 4 distinct colors, leaving no available color for vertex 7 itself. The graph cannot be 4-colored.
