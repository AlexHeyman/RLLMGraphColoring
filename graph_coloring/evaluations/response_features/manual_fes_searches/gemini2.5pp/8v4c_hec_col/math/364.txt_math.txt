To determine if the graph can be colored with four colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow) such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color, we need to determine if the chromatic number of the graph G, denoted χ(G), is less than or equal to 4.

The graph G has V = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} and the set of edges E = {(0,1), (0,2), (0,4), (0,6), (0,7), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,4), (3,5), (3,7), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)}.

Let's list the neighbors (adjacency list) for each vertex:
Adj(0) = {1, 2, 4, 6, 7}
Adj(1) = {0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
Adj(2) = {0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
Adj(3) = {1, 2, 4, 5, 7}
Adj(4) = {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6}
Adj(5) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7}
Adj(6) = {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7}
Adj(7) = {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6}

A clique is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are adjacent. If a graph contains a clique of size k (a Kk subgraph), then its chromatic number must be at least k (χ(G) >= k).
Let's search for a clique of size 5 (K5). If we find one, then χ(G) >= 5, and the graph cannot be colored with 4 colors.
Consider the set of vertices {1, 4, 5, 6, 7}. Let's check the edges between them.
(1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7) - Yes
(4,5), (4,6) - Yes. (4,7)? Let's check the edge list or adjacency lists. Adj(4) = {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6}. Vertex 7 is not in Adj(4). So edge (4,7) is missing. This set is not a K5.
Consider the set {2, 4, 5, 6, 7}.
(2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7) - Yes
(4,5), (4,6) - Yes. (4,7)? No. This set is not a K5.

Let's try to color the graph with 4 colors (R, G, B, Y). We can use a backtracking approach.
Assign colors vertex by vertex:
1. C(0) = Red
2. C(1) = Green (adjacent to 0(Red))
3. C(2) = Blue (adjacent to 0(Red), not adjacent to 1(Green) as (1,2) is not an edge)
4. C(3) = Yellow (adjacent to 1(Green), 2(Blue), not adjacent to 0(Red) as (0,3) is not an edge)
Current partial coloring: 0:R, 1:G, 2:B, 3:Y.
5. Consider vertex 4. Adj(4) = {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6}. Vertex 4 is adjacent to:
   - 0 (Red)
   - 1 (Green)
   - 2 (Blue)
   - 3 (Yellow)
Since vertex 4 is adjacent to vertices that have all four colors, there is no available color for vertex 4. This specific coloring attempt failed.

This failure suggests that the graph might not be 4-colorable. Let's try to confirm this using graph minors. A graph G contains a Kk minor if Kk can be obtained from a subgraph of G by contracting edges. If a graph G contains a K5 minor, then χ(G) >= χ(K5) = 5. It is a known result (related to the Four Color Theorem) that a graph with a K5 minor is not 4-colorable.

Let's check if G contains a K5 minor. Consider contracting the edge (0,1) into a single vertex X. The new graph G' has vertex set V' = {X, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}. The vertex X is adjacent to any vertex v if 0 or 1 was adjacent to v in G.
Adj(X) = Adj(0) U Adj(1) \ {0,1} = {1, 2, 4, 6, 7} U {0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} \ {0,1} = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}.
Now consider the subset of vertices S = {X, 2, 4, 5, 6} in G'. Let's check if the subgraph induced by S, denoted G'[S], is a K5. We need to check if all pairs of vertices in S are adjacent in G'.
Edges involving X: (X, 2), (X, 4), (X, 5), (X, 6). All exist because {2, 4, 5, 6} is a subset of Adj(X).
Edges not involving X (these edges must exist in the original graph G):
(2,4)? Yes.
(2,5)? Yes.
(2,6)? Yes.
(4,5)? Yes.
(4,6)? Yes.
(5,6)? Yes.
All pairs of vertices in S = {X, 2, 4, 5, 6} are adjacent. Thus, G'[S] is a K5.
Since G contains a K5 minor, its chromatic number χ(G) must be at least 5.
Therefore, the graph G cannot be colored with only 4 colors.
