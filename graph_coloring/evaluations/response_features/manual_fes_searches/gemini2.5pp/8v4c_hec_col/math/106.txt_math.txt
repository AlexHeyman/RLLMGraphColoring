To determine if the graph can be colored with 4 colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow) such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color, we need to check if the chromatic number of the graph $\chi(G)$ is less than or equal to 4.

The graph G has vertices $V = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}$ and edges $E = \{(0,1), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,6), (1,7), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)\}$. There are 22 edges in this list.

Let's find the adjacency list for each vertex:
N(0) = {1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
N(1) = {0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7}
N(2) = {1, 3, 4, 5, 6}
N(3) = {0, 1, 2, 6, 7}
N(4) = {0, 1, 2, 5, 6}
N(5) = {0, 2, 4, 6, 7}
N(6) = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7}
N(7) = {0, 1, 3, 5, 6}

A clique in a graph is a subset of vertices such that every two distinct vertices in the clique are adjacent. If a graph G contains a clique of size k (denoted as $K_k$), then its chromatic number $\chi(G)$ must be at least k. This is because all vertices in a clique must be assigned different colors in any proper coloring.

Let's search for a clique in G. Consider the subset of vertices $S = \{0, 1, 3, 6, 7\}$. Let's check if this forms a $K_5$. We need to verify that every pair of vertices in S is connected by an edge.
The pairs are:
(0,1): Edge (0,1) is in E. Yes.
(0,3): Edge (0,3) is in E. Yes.
(0,6): Edge (0,6) is in E. Yes.
(0,7): Edge (0,7) is in E. Yes.
(1,3): Edge (1,3) is in E. Yes.
(1,6): Edge (1,6) is in E. Yes.
(1,7): Edge (1,7) is in E. Yes.
(3,6): Edge (3,6) is in E. Yes.
(3,7): Edge (3,7) is in E. Yes.
(6,7): Edge (6,7) is in E. Yes.
All 10 pairs of vertices in S are connected by an edge. Therefore, the subgraph induced by S is a $K_5$.

Since the graph G contains a $K_5$ subgraph, the chromatic number $\chi(G)$ must be at least 5. This means that at least 5 different colors are required to properly color the vertices of G.

The problem asks if it is possible to color the graph with only 4 colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow). Since $\chi(G) \ge 5$, it is impossible to color the graph G using only 4 colors.

Impossible
