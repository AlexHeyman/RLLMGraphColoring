To determine if the graph can be colored with 4 colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow) such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color, we need to check if the graph's chromatic number is less than or equal to 4.

A key property related to graph coloring is the clique number, ω(G), which is the size of the largest complete subgraph (clique) within the graph G. The chromatic number, χ(G), must be greater than or equal to the clique number (χ(G) ≥ ω(G)). If we can find a clique of size 5 (a K5 subgraph), then we would need at least 5 colors, making a 4-coloring impossible.

Let's examine the vertices and their connections to find potential cliques.

Vertices: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
Edges: {(0,1), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,2), (1,3), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (2,3), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,6), (5,7)}

Consider the set of vertices {0, 1, 3, 6, 7}. Let's check if all pairs of vertices within this set are connected by an edge:
- (0,1): Yes
- (0,3): Yes
- (0,6): Yes
- (0,7): Yes
- (1,3): Yes
- (1,6): Yes
- (1,7): Yes
- (3,6): Yes
- (3,7): Yes
- (6,7): Yes

All 10 possible edges between the 5 vertices {0, 1, 3, 6, 7} exist in the graph's edge set. This means that these 5 vertices form a complete subgraph K5.

In any valid coloring, all vertices in a K5 must have distinct colors because every vertex is adjacent to every other vertex in the clique. Since we have a K5 subgraph, we need at least 5 different colors to color these 5 vertices.

However, we are only allowed to use 4 colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow). Therefore, it is impossible to color this graph according to the rules.

Impossible
