Let G = (V, E) be the graph with V = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} and E = {(0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (1,2), (1,3), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (4,7), (6,7)}.
We want to determine if G is 4-colorable, meaning we can assign one of four colors (say Red, Green, Blue, Yellow) to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.

Let's analyze the neighborhood of vertex 5. The neighbors of vertex 5 are N(5) = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6}.
Consider the subgraph induced by N(5), denoted by G[N(5)]. This subgraph consists of the vertices {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6} and all edges from E that connect two vertices within this set.

Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that G is 4-colorable. Let C be a valid 4-coloring of G. Let the color assigned to vertex 5 be C(5). Since the four colors are Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, C(5) must be one of these.
By the definition of graph coloring, every neighbor v in N(5) must have a color C(v) such that C(v) != C(5). This means that all vertices in N(5) must be colored using only the three colors that are not C(5).
This implies that the subgraph G[N(5)] must be 3-colorable.

Now, let's examine the subgraph G[N(5)]. Consider the subset of vertices {0, 1, 2, 6} within N(5). Let's check if these four vertices form a clique (a K4) in G (and thus in G[N(5)]). We need to check if all pairs of vertices from {0, 1, 2, 6} are connected by an edge in E:
- (0,1) is in E.
- (0,2) is in E.
- (0,6) is in E.
- (1,2) is in E.
- (1,6) is in E.
- (2,6) is in E.
All 6 pairs are connected by edges. Thus, the vertices {0, 1, 2, 6} form a K4 subgraph within G[N(5)].

A graph containing a K4 subgraph requires at least 4 colors. The chromatic number of G[N(5)], denoted Ï‡(G[N(5)]), must be at least 4.
This contradicts our earlier deduction that G[N(5)] must be 3-colorable if G is 4-colorable.

Since we reached a contradiction, our initial assumption that G is 4-colorable must be false.

Therefore, it is impossible to color the vertices of the given graph using only four colors such that no two adjacent vertices receive the same color.

Impossible
