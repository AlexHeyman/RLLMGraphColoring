Let V = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} be the set of vertices and E be the set of edges.
We want to determine if this graph G = (V, E) is 4-colorable. A graph is k-colorable if we can assign one of k colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.

A common reason for a graph not being k-colorable is the presence of a (k+1)-clique (a subgraph K_{k+1} where all k+1 vertices are connected to each other). In this case, we are checking for 4-colorability, so we should look for a 5-clique (K5).

Let's list the neighbors (adjacency list) for each vertex:
N(0): {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7}
N(1): {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
N(2): {0, 1, 4, 6, 7}
N(3): {0, 1, 4, 5, 7}
N(4): {0, 1, 2, 3, 5}
N(5): {1, 3, 4, 6, 7}
N(6): {0, 1, 2, 5, 7}
N(7): {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6}

Consider vertices 4 and 7. They are not adjacent (the edge (4,7) is not in E).
Let the four available colors be C1, C2, C3, C4.

Case 1: Vertices 4 and 7 have different colors.
Assume Color(4) = C1 and Color(7) = C2.
Consider the set of common neighbors of 4 and 7: CN = N(4) âˆ© N(7).
N(4) = {0, 1, 2, 3, 5}
N(7) = {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6}
CN = {0, 1, 2, 3, 5}.
Every vertex v in CN is adjacent to vertex 4 (color C1) and vertex 7 (color C2). Therefore, the color of v cannot be C1 or C2. This means all vertices in CN = {0, 1, 2, 3, 5} must be colored using only the remaining two colors, {C3, C4}.
We need to check if the subgraph induced by CN is 2-colorable. A graph is 2-colorable if and only if it contains no odd cycles.
Let's examine the edges within the subgraph induced by {0, 1, 2, 3, 5}:
Edges are: (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,2), (1,3), (1,5), (3,5).
Consider the cycle 1-3-5-1. The edges are (1,3), (3,5), (5,1) (which is the same as (1,5)). All these edges exist in the original graph. This is a cycle of length 3, which is odd.
Since the subgraph induced by {0, 1, 2, 3, 5} contains an odd cycle, it is not 2-colorable.
Therefore, it's impossible to color the vertices {0, 1, 2, 3, 5} using only two colors {C3, C4}.
This means Case 1 (Color(4) != Color(7)) is impossible under a valid 4-coloring.

Case 2: Vertices 4 and 7 have the same color.
Assume Color(4) = Color(7) = C1.
Consider the union of the neighbors of 4 and 7: N(4) U N(7) = {0, 1, 2, 3, 5} U {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6} = {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6}.
Every vertex v in this set is adjacent to either vertex 4 or vertex 7 (or both). Since Color(4) = Color(7) = C1, none of the vertices in {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6} can have color C1.
Therefore, all vertices in the set S = {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6} must be colored using only the remaining three colors {C2, C3, C4}.
We need to check if the subgraph induced by S is 3-colorable. A graph that contains a K4 (a 4-clique) cannot be 3-colored. Let's look for a K4 within S = {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6}.
Consider the subset {0, 1, 2, 6}. Let's check if all pairs are connected by an edge:
(0,1) - Yes
(0,2) - Yes
(0,6) - Yes
(1,2) - Yes
(1,6) - Yes
(2,6) - Yes
All 6 pairs of vertices in {0, 1, 2, 6} are connected by edges. This means {0, 1, 2, 6} forms a K4.
A K4 requires 4 distinct colors for its vertices in any valid coloring. However, the vertices {0, 1, 2, 6} are part of the set S which must be colored using only 3 colors ({C2, C3, C4}). This is impossible.
Therefore, Case 2 (Color(4) = Color(7)) is also impossible under a valid 4-coloring.

Since both possible cases for the colors of vertices 4 and 7 lead to contradictions, the graph cannot be 4-colored.
