Let $G = (V, E)$ be the graph with $V = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}$ and $E = \{(0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (1,2), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (2,3), (2,4), (2,6), (2,7), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,6), (5,7)\}$.
We want to determine if $G$ can be colored with 4 colors (say Red, Green, Blue, Yellow) such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. This is equivalent to determining if the chromatic number $\chi(G)$ is less than or equal to 4.

Let's find the clique number $\omega(G)$, which is the size of the largest clique (a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are adjacent) in $G$. The chromatic number $\chi(G)$ must be greater than or equal to $\omega(G)$.

Consider the subset of vertices $K = \{3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}$. Let's check if this forms a clique. We need to verify that every pair of distinct vertices in $K$ is connected by an edge.
The edges involving vertices in $K$ are:
(3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7)
(4,5), (4,6), (4,7)
(5,6), (5,7)
(6,7)
Let's check if these edges are present in the given edge set $E$.
(3,4) $\in E$
(3,5) $\in E$
(3,6) $\in E$
(3,7) $\in E$
(4,5) $\in E$
(4,6) $\in E$
(4,7) $\in E$
(5,6) $\in E$
(5,7) $\in E$
(6,7) $\in E$
All these 10 edges are present in $E$. The number of pairs of vertices in $K$ is $\binom{5}{2} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2} = 10$. Since all 10 pairs are connected by an edge, the subgraph induced by $K = \{3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}$ is a complete graph $K_5$.

For any valid coloring of $G$, all vertices in the clique $K$ must receive distinct colors. Since $K$ has 5 vertices, we need at least 5 distinct colors.
Let $c$ be a valid coloring of $G$. Then for any two distinct vertices $u, v \in K$, $c(u) \ne c(v)$. This implies that the set $\{c(3), c(4), c(5), c(6), c(7)\}$ must contain 5 distinct colors.

The problem asks if the graph can be colored using only 4 colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow). Since we have found a clique of size 5, we know that at least 5 colors are required ($\chi(G) \ge \omega(G) = 5$).
Therefore, it is impossible to color the graph $G$ with only 4 colors.
