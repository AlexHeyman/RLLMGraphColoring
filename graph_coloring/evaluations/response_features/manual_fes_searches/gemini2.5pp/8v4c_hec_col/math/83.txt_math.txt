Let $G = (V, E)$ be the graph with $V = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}$ and $E = \{(0,1), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,2), (1,3), (1,6), (2,4), (2,6), (2,7), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,6), (5,7)\}$. We want to determine if $G$ is 4-colorable. Let the four colors be $C = \{\text{Red, Green, Blue, Yellow}\}$.

Consider the subset of vertices $W = \{0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}$. Let $H$ be the subgraph of $G$ induced by $W$. The vertices in $H$ are $W$, and the edges in $H$ are the edges of $G$ with both endpoints in $W$.
Let's list the edges of $H$:
Edges incident to 0 in $G$: (0,1), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7). Edges in $H$: (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7).
Edges incident to 3 in $G$: (3,0), (3,1), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7). Edges in $H$: (3,0), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7).
Edges incident to 4 in $G$: (4,0), (4,2), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7). Edges in $H$: (4,0), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7).
Edges incident to 5 in $G$: (5,0), (5,3), (5,4), (5,6), (5,7). Edges in $H$: (5,0), (5,3), (5,4), (5,6), (5,7).
Edges incident to 6 in $G$: (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,7). Edges in $H$: (6,0), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,7).
Edges incident to 7 in $G$: (7,0), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). Edges in $H$: (7,0), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6).

The set of edges in $H$ is $E_H = \{(0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)\}$.
There are 14 edges in $H$.
A complete graph on 6 vertices ($K_6$) has $\binom{6}{2} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2} = 15$ edges.
Let's check which edge is missing from $H$ to be a $K_6$. The vertices are {0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}.
The pairs of vertices are: (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7).
Comparing this list with the edges in $E_H$, we see that the edge (3,4) is missing.
So, the induced subgraph $H = G[W]$ is $K_6 - e$, where $e=(3,4)$.

We need to find the chromatic number of $H = K_6 - e$. Let $V(H) = \{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5, v_6\}$. Let the missing edge be $(v_5, v_6)$.
Consider coloring $H$ with $k$ colors. The chromatic number of $K_6$ is 6. Removing an edge can reduce the chromatic number by at most 1. So $\chi(H) \ge \chi(K_6) - 1 = 5$.
Let's show that $H$ can be colored with 5 colors. Let the colors be $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$.
Assign $c(v_1)=1, c(v_2)=2, c(v_3)=3, c(v_4)=4$.
Vertex $v_5$ is adjacent to $v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4$. So $c(v_5)$ must be different from {1, 2, 3, 4}. Let $c(v_5)=5$.
Vertex $v_6$ is adjacent to $v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4$. So $c(v_6)$ must be different from {1, 2, 3, 4}. Let $c(v_6)=5$.
Since the edge $(v_5, v_6)$ is missing, $v_5$ and $v_6$ are not adjacent, so they can have the same color.
Thus, $H = K_6 - e$ can be colored with 5 colors. $\chi(H) = 5$.

Since $H$ is a subgraph of $G$, the chromatic number of $G$ must be at least the chromatic number of $H$.
$\chi(G) \ge \chi(H) = 5$.
This means that $G$ cannot be colored with only 4 colors.

Alternatively, consider vertex 5 and its neighbors $N(5) = \{0, 3, 4, 6, 7\}$.
The subgraph induced by $N(5)$ is $G[N(5)]$. The vertices are {0, 3, 4, 6, 7}. The edges are {(0,3), (0,4), (0,6), (0,7), (3,6), (3,7), (4,6), (4,7), (6,7)}. This subgraph is $K_5 - e'$, where $e'=(3,4)$.
The chromatic number of $K_5 - e'$ is 4. Let the 4 colors be $C = \{c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4\}$. Any 4-coloring of $G[N(5)]$ must use all 4 colors. For example, assign $c(0)=c_1, c(6)=c_2, c(7)=c_3$. Then $c(3)$ must be $c_4$ (since 3 is adjacent to 0, 6, 7). Also $c(4)$ must be $c_4$ (since 4 is adjacent to 0, 6, 7). Since (3,4) is not an edge, this is a valid coloring. The set of colors used is $\{c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4\}$.
Now consider vertex 5. It is adjacent to all vertices in $N(5)$. Therefore, the color of vertex 5 must be different from the colors of all vertices in $N(5)$.
$c(5) \notin \{c(0), c(3), c(4), c(6), c(7)\} = \{c_1, c_4, c_4, c_2, c_3\} = \{c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4\}$.
This means that $c(5)$ must be a fifth color, different from the 4 colors used to color $N(5)$.
Therefore, at least 5 colors are required to color the graph $G$.

Since the graph requires 5 colors, it is impossible to color it with only 4 colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow).
