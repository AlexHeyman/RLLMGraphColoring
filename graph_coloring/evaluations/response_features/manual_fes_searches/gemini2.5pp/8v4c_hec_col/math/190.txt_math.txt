Okay, let's analyze the graph and the coloring requirement.

1.  **Identify the Graph:**
    *   Vertices: V = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
    *   Edges: E = {(0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (1,2), (1,3), (1,6), (1,7), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,4), (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (4,7), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)}
    *   Colors: {Red, Green, Blue, Yellow} (4 colors)

2.  **Analyze Connectivity:** We need to determine if the graph can be colored with 4 colors such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. This is equivalent to checking if the chromatic number of the graph, Ï‡(G), is less than or equal to 4.

3.  **Look for Dense Subgraphs (Cliques):** A clique is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices in the clique are adjacent. If a graph contains a clique of size k (K_k), it requires at least k colors.
    *   Consider vertex 7. Its neighbors are {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.
    *   Let's examine the subgraph induced by the neighbors of 7, i.e., the subgraph G' with vertices V' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. The edges within this subgraph are those from the original list E where both endpoints are in V':
        E' = {(1,2), (1,3), (1,6), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,6), (4,5), (5,6)}
    *   We need to determine the minimum number of colors required for G'. Let's try to color G' using 3 colors (Green, Blue, Yellow), assuming vertex 7 will use the 4th color (Red).
        *   Color 1: Green
        *   Color 2 (adjacent to 1): Blue
        *   Color 3 (adjacent to 1): Blue (Note: 2 and 3 are not adjacent)
        *   Color 4 (adjacent to 2(Blue), 3(Blue)): Green
        *   Color 5 (adjacent to 2(Blue), 4(Green)): Yellow
        *   Color 6 (adjacent to 1(Green), 2(Blue), 3(Blue), 5(Yellow)): The neighbors of 6 in G' are {1, 2, 3, 5}. Their assigned colors are Green, Blue, Blue, Yellow. The set of colors used by neighbors is {Green, Blue, Yellow}. All 3 available colors are used. Therefore, vertex 6 cannot be colored with Green, Blue, or Yellow.
    *   This shows that the subgraph G' induced by {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} requires at least 4 colors. Let's call these colors C1, C2, C3, C4.

4.  **Connect Back to the Original Graph:**
    *   The subgraph G' (vertices {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}) requires 4 colors.
    *   Vertex 7 is adjacent to *every* vertex in G'.
    *   Therefore, the color assigned to vertex 7 must be different from the colors assigned to all vertices in G'.
    *   Since the vertices in G' must use 4 distinct colors among themselves in any valid 4-coloring, vertex 7 would require a 5th color that is different from those 4.
    *   Since we only have 4 colors available (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow), it is impossible to color vertex 7 while satisfying the condition that adjacent vertices have different colors.

5.  **Conclusion:** The graph cannot be colored with only 4 colors.

Impossible
