Let the 8 people be represented by the vertices of a graph G = (V, E), where V = {Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather}. Let's use their initials: V = {A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H}.
The friendships define the edges E of the graph. The adjacency list is as follows:
A: B, D, F, H
B: A, C, E, F, G, H
C: B, D, F, H
D: A, C, E, F, H
E: B, D, G, H
F: A, B, C, D, G, H
G: B, E, F, H
H: A, B, C, D, E, F, G

We are asked if this graph G can be colored with 4 colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow) such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. This is equivalent to asking if the chromatic number of G, denoted χ(G), is less than or equal to 4.

Let the set of colors be C = {Red, Green, Blue, Yellow}. Let's denote them by {1, 2, 3, 4}.

Consider the vertex H. H is friends with A, B, C, D, E, F, G. This means H is adjacent to all other 7 vertices in the graph.
Let G' be the subgraph induced by the vertices V' = {A, B, C, D, E, F, G}.
For G to be 4-colorable, we must be able to assign a color to H from the 4 available colors. The color assigned to H must be different from the colors assigned to all its neighbors, which are all vertices in V'.
Let c be a 4-coloring of G. Then c(H) must be different from c(v) for all v in V'.
This implies that the set of colors used to color the vertices in V', {c(A), c(B), c(C), c(D), c(E), c(F), c(G)}, must not contain all 4 available colors. In other words, the subgraph G' must be colorable with 3 colors, or it must be 4-colorable in a way that uses only 3 colors.

Let's test if G' is 3-colorable. We can use a greedy coloring approach with 3 colors {1, 2, 3}. Let's try coloring the vertices of G' in alphabetical order:
1.  Assign A color 1 (Red). Neighbors B, D, F cannot be color 1.
2.  Assign B color 2 (Green). Neighbors A(1), C, E, F, G. B cannot be 1. B=2 is valid. Neighbors C, E, F, G cannot be color 2.
3.  Assign C color 1 (Red). Neighbors B(2), D, F. C cannot be 2. C=1 is valid since C is not adjacent to A(1). Neighbors D, F cannot be color 1.
4.  Assign D color 3 (Blue). Neighbors A(1), C(1), E, F. D cannot be 1. D=3 is valid. Neighbors E, F cannot be color 3.
5.  Assign E color 1 (Red). Neighbors B(2), D(3), G. E cannot be 2 or 3. E=1 is valid since E is not adjacent to A(1) or C(1). Neighbor G cannot be color 1.
6.  Consider F. Neighbors of F in G' are A, B, C, D, G. Their assigned colors are A(1), B(2), C(1), D(3). F is adjacent to vertices with colors 1, 2, and 3. Therefore, F cannot be assigned color 1, 2, or 3.

This attempt to 3-color G' failed because vertex F requires a fourth color. This proves that the subgraph G' is not 3-colorable, so χ(G') ≥ 4.

Since G' is a subgraph of G, G' must be colorable with the 4 available colors. Let's verify this and find a 4-coloring for G'. We can continue the previous coloring attempt by assigning F the 4th color:
1. A = 1 (Red)
2. B = 2 (Green)
3. C = 1 (Red)
4. D = 2 (Green). Neighbors A(1), C(1), E, F. D cannot be 1. D=2 is valid since D is not adjacent to B(2). Neighbors E, F cannot be 2.
5. E = 1 (Red). Neighbors B(2), D(2), G. E cannot be 2. E=1 is valid (not adjacent to A(1), C(1)). Neighbor G cannot be 1.
6. F = 3 (Blue). Neighbors A(1), B(2), C(1), D(2), G. F cannot be 1 or 2. F=3 is valid. Neighbor G cannot be 3.
7. G = 4 (Yellow). Neighbors B(2), E(1), F(3). G cannot be 1, 2, 3. G=4 is valid.

So, a valid 4-coloring of G' is:
A: Red (1)
B: Green (2)
C: Red (1)
D: Green (2)
E: Red (1)
F: Blue (3)
G: Yellow (4)

This coloring uses all 4 colors: Red, Green, Blue, Yellow.
Since χ(G') ≥ 4 and G' is 4-colorable, we have χ(G') = 4.
This means that any valid 4-coloring of the subgraph G' must use all 4 colors. (If a 4-coloring used only 3 colors, G' would be 3-colorable, which we've shown is false).

Now consider vertex H. H is adjacent to all vertices in G' (A, B, C, D, E, F, G). In any valid 4-coloring of the full graph G, the vertices in G' must be colored, and as shown, they will require the use of all 4 colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow).
Since H must have a color different from all its neighbors, H would need a fifth color. However, only 4 colors are available.
Therefore, it is impossible to color the graph G with only 4 colors while satisfying the given condition.

Let the 8 people be represented by the vertices of a graph G = (V, E), where V = {#0, #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7}. Let's use their initials: V = {A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H}.
The friendships define the edges E of the graph. The adjacency list is as follows:
A: B, D, F, H
B: A, C, E, F, G, H
C: B, D, F, H
D: A, C, E, F, H
E: B, D, G, H
F: A, B, C, D, G, H
G: B, E, F, H
H: A, B, C, D, E, F, G

We are asked if this graph G can be colored with 4 colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow) such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. This is equivalent to asking if the chromatic number of G, denoted χ(G), is less than or equal to 4.

Let the set of colors be C = {Red, Green, Blue, Yellow}. Let's denote them by {1, 2, 3, 4}.

Consider the vertex H. H is friends with A, B, C, D, E, F, G. This means H is adjacent to all other 7 vertices in the graph.
Let G' be the subgraph induced by the vertices V' = {A, B, C, D, E, F, G}.
For G to be 4-colorable, we must be able to assign a color to H from the 4 available colors. The color assigned to H must be different from the colors assigned to all its neighbors, which are all vertices in V'.
Let c be a 4-coloring of G. Then c(H) must be different from c(v) for all v in V'.
This implies that the set of colors used to color the vertices in V', {c(A), c(B), c(C), c(D), c(E), c(F), c(G)}, must not contain all 4 available colors. In other words, the subgraph G' must be colorable with 3 colors, or it must be 4-colorable in a way that uses only 3 colors.

Let's test if G' is 3-colorable. We can use a greedy coloring approach with 3 colors {1, 2, 3}. Let's try coloring the vertices of G' in alphabetical order:
1.  Assign A color 1 (Red). Neighbors B, D, F cannot be color 1.
2.  Assign B color 2 (Green). Neighbors A(1), C, E, F, G. B cannot be 1. B=2 is valid. Neighbors C, E, F, G cannot be color 2.
3.  Assign C color 1 (Red). Neighbors B(2), D, F. C cannot be 2. C=1 is valid since C is not adjacent to A(1). Neighbors D, F cannot be color 1.
4.  Assign D color 3 (Blue). Neighbors A(1), C(1), E, F. D cannot be 1. D=3 is valid. Neighbors E, F cannot be color 3.
5.  Assign E color 1 (Red). Neighbors B(2), D(3), G. E cannot be 2 or 3. E=1 is valid since E is not adjacent to A(1) or C(1). Neighbor G cannot be color 1.
6.  Consider F. Neighbors of F in G' are A, B, C, D, G. Their assigned colors are A(1), B(2), C(1), D(3). F is adjacent to vertices with colors 1, 2, and 3. Therefore, F cannot be assigned color 1, 2, or 3.

This attempt to 3-color G' failed because vertex F requires a fourth color. This proves that the subgraph G' is not 3-colorable, so χ(G') ≥ 4.

Since G' is a subgraph of G, G' must be colorable with the 4 available colors. Let's verify this and find a 4-coloring for G'. We can continue the previous coloring attempt by assigning F the 4th color:
1. A = 1 (Red)
2. B = 2 (Green)
3. C = 1 (Red)
4. D = 2 (Green). Neighbors A(1), C(1), E, F. D cannot be 1. D=2 is valid since D is not adjacent to B(2). Neighbors E, F cannot be 2.
5. E = 1 (Red). Neighbors B(2), D(2), G. E cannot be 2. E=1 is valid (not adjacent to A(1), C(1)). Neighbor G cannot be 1.
6. F = 3 (Blue). Neighbors A(1), B(2), C(1), D(2), G. F cannot be 1 or 2. F=3 is valid. Neighbor G cannot be 3.
7. G = 4 (Yellow). Neighbors B(2), E(1), F(3). G cannot be 1, 2, 3. G=4 is valid.

So, a valid 4-coloring of G' is:
A: Red (1)
B: Green (2)
C: Red (1)
D: Green (2)
E: Red (1)
F: Blue (3)
G: Yellow (4)

This coloring uses all 4 colors: Red, Green, Blue, Yellow.
Since χ(G') ≥ 4 and G' is 4-colorable, we have χ(G') = 4.
This means that any valid 4-coloring of the subgraph G' must use all 4 colors. (If a 4-coloring used only 3 colors, G' would be 3-colorable, which we've shown is false).

Now consider vertex H. H is adjacent to all vertices in G' (A, B, C, D, E, F, G). In any valid 4-coloring of the full graph G, the vertices in G' must be colored, and as shown, they will require the use of all 4 colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow).
Since H must have a color different from all its neighbors, H would need a fifth color. However, only 4 colors are available.
Therefore, it is impossible to color the graph G with only 4 colors while satisfying the given condition.
