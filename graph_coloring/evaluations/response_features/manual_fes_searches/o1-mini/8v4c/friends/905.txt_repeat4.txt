After analyzing the friendship connections and the constraints on shirt colors, it's **Impossible** to assign each of the 8 people a shirt color (Red, Green, Blue, or Yellow) such that no friends wear the same color.

**Reasoning:**

- **Ethan (E)** is friends with Alice (A), Bob (B), Dave (D), George (G), and Heather (H). To ensure none of Ethan's friends share his shirt color, all four available colors would need to be used by his friends.
  
- Assigning different colors to Alice, Bob, Dave, and George (who are all friends with Ethan) would exhaust all four color options, leaving no valid color for Ethan.

This situation creates a scenario where Ethan cannot choose a shirt color without conflicting with at least one of his friends, making the desired color assignment impossible.

**Final Answer:**

Impossible

After analyzing the friendship connections and the constraints on shirt colors, it's **Impossible** to assign each of the 8 people a shirt color (Red, Green, Blue, or Yellow) such that no friends wear the same color.

**Reasoning:**

- **#4 (E)** is friends with #0 (A), #1 (B), #3 (D), #6 (G), and #7 (H). To ensure none of #4's friends share his shirt color, all four available colors would need to be used by his friends.
  
- Assigning different colors to #0, #1, #3, and #6 (who are all friends with #4) would exhaust all four color options, leaving no valid color for #4.

This situation creates a scenario where #4 cannot choose a shirt color without conflicting with at least one of his friends, making the desired color assignment impossible.

**Final Answer:**

Impossible
