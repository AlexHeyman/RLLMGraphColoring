After analyzing the friendship connections among the eight individuals, it becomes clear that assigning one of four colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow) to each person without any two friends sharing the same color is not feasible. The high number of interconnections, especially involving Fran, creates conflicts that cannot be resolved within the four-color constraint.
