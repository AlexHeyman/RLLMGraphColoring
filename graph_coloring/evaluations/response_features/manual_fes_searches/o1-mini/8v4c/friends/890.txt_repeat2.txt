Evaluation: impossible incorrect

---

After analyzing the friendship connections and attempting various color assignments, it becomes clear that it's impossible to assign one of four colors (red, green, blue, or yellow) to each person such that no two friends share the same color. The constraints create a situation where at least one person would have to wear a fifth color, which isn't available.
