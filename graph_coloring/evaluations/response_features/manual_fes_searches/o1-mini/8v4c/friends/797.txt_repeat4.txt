Evaluation: impossible incorrect

After analyzing the friendship connections among the 8 individuals, it's clear that each person has multiple friends, resulting in a highly interconnected network. Specifically:

- **Alice**, **Bob**, and **Heather** each have **5 friends**.
- The required constraint is that no two friends can wear the same color shirt.
- With only **4 colors** available (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow), it's impossible to assign colors such that all friends have distinct colors without causing a conflict.

Given the high degree of connectivity among some individuals and the limited number of colors, there's no valid way to assign colors that satisfy all the constraints.

**Impossible**
