To determine if it's possible for all 8 individuals to wear shirts of different colors from their friends, we can model the friendships as a graph where each person is a node, and an edge connects two nodes if they are friends. The goal is to color each node with one of four colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow) such that no two connected nodes share the same color.

**Key Observations:**

1. **4-Clique Presence:** There exists a group of four friends (Alice, Carol, Dave, Ethan) where each person is friends with the other three. This forms a **4-clique**, meaning each of these four must wear a distinct color.

2. **Color Constraints:**
   - With only four colors available and the 4-clique already using all four, any additional friendships outside this clique can create conflicts.
   - For instance, Ethan is also friends with George and Heather, limiting their color choices further and leading to situations where a person may run out of available colors.

3. **Attempted Assignments:**
   - Multiple attempts to assign colors while respecting the constraints led to situations where at least one individual could not be assigned any of the four colors without conflicting with a friend.

Given these constraints and the inherent conflicts arising from the friendships, it is **impossible** to assign colors such that no two friends wear the same color.

**Answer:**

Impossible
