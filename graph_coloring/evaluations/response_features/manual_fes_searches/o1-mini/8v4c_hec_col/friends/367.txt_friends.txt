To determine if it's possible for all eight people to wear shirts of different colors without any friends wearing the same color, we can model this scenario as a graph coloring problem. Here's how:

1. **Model the Friendships as a Graph:**
   - Each person represents a node in the graph.
   - An edge connects two nodes if the corresponding people are friends.

2. **Identify Complete Subgraphs:**
   - A **complete graph** (denoted as \( K_n \)) is one where every pair of distinct nodes is connected by an edge.
   - In this scenario, consider the following subset of people: **Alice, Carol, Dave, Ethan, and Heather**.
   - Each of these individuals is friends with every other individual in this subset.
   - This forms a \( K_5 \) (a complete graph with 5 nodes).

3. **Apply Graph Coloring Principles:**
   - The **chromatic number** of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color the nodes so that no two adjacent nodes share the same color.
   - For a \( K_5 \), the chromatic number is **5**.
   - However, we are restricted to using only **4 colors**: red, green, blue, and yellow.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since at least 5 different colors are needed to color the \( K_5 \) subgraph without any two friends sharing the same color, it's **impossible** to satisfy the coloring requirements with only 4 colors.

**Impossible**
