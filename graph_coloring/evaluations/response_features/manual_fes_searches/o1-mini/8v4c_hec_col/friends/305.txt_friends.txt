After analyzing the friendship relationships and the constraints on shirt colors, it is **impossible** to assign one of four colors (red, green, blue, or yellow) to each of the eight people such that no two friends wear the same color.

**Explanation:**

1. **Ethan's Connections:** Ethan is friends with all seven other individuals (Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Fran, George, and Heather). This means Ethan must wear a unique color that none of his friends wear.

2. **Color Limitation for Friends:** With only four colors available, once Ethan's color is assigned, the remaining seven friends must share the remaining three colors. However, the friends are highly interconnected:
   - **Alice** is friends with Bob, Dave, Fran, George, and Heather.
   - **Bob** is friends with Carol, Dave, Fran, and Heather.
   - **Carol** is friends with Dave, Ethan, George, and Heather.
   - **Dave** is friends with Fran, George, and Heather.
   - **Fran** is friends with George.
   - **George** is friends with Heather.
   
   Given these connections, it's impossible to assign colors to all seven friends without violating the constraint that no two friends share the same color.

Therefore, no valid color assignment exists under the given conditions.

**Impossible**

After analyzing the friendship relationships and the constraints on shirt colors, it is **impossible** to assign one of four colors (red, green, blue, or yellow) to each of the eight people such that no two friends wear the same color.

**Explanation:**

1. **#4's Connections:** #4 is friends with all seven other individuals (#0, #1, #2, #3, #5, #6, and #7). This means #4 must wear a unique color that none of his friends wear.

2. **Color Limitation for Friends:** With only four colors available, once #4's color is assigned, the remaining seven friends must share the remaining three colors. However, the friends are highly interconnected:
   - **#0** is friends with #1, #3, #5, #6, and #7.
   - **#1** is friends with #2, #3, #5, and #7.
   - **#2** is friends with #3, #4, #6, and #7.
   - **#3** is friends with #5, #6, and #7.
   - **#5** is friends with #6.
   - **#6** is friends with #7.
   
   Given these connections, it's impossible to assign colors to all seven friends without violating the constraint that no two friends share the same color.

Therefore, no valid color assignment exists under the given conditions.
