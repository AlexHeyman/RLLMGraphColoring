To determine if it's possible for the eight friends to wear shirts in four colors—**Red**, **Green**, **Blue**, and **Yellow**—such that no two friends share the same color, we can analyze the friendships as a graph coloring problem. Here's a step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Friendship Graph Analysis:**
   - **Alice (A)** is connected to six people: Bob (B), Carol (C), Dave (D), Ethan (E), Fran (F), and Heather (H).
   - **George (G)** and **Heather (H)** also have high degrees of connection, further complicating the color assignments.
   
2. **Color Assignment Challenges:**
   - **Alice (A)** must wear a unique color, say **Red**.
   - Her friends (**B, C, D, E, F, H**) then cannot wear **Red** and must choose from **Green**, **Blue**, or **Yellow**.
   - The interconnectedness among **B, C, D, E, F, G, H** means that assigning colors without overlap becomes exceedingly difficult.
   - Attempts to allocate colors invariably lead to a situation where **Heather (H)**, connected to multiple friends already wearing all four colors, has no available color left.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - After extensive analysis and multiple color assignment attempts, it's clear that it's impossible to satisfy all the constraints with only four colors.

**Impossible**
