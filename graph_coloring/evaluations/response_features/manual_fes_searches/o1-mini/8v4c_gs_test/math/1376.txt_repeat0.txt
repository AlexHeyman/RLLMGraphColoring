Evaluation: impossible incorrect

After analyzing the graph, it is **impossible** to color all vertices using only four colors (Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow) such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. The constraints lead to a situation where at least one vertex cannot be assigned any of the available colors without violating the adjacency rules.

**Final Answer:**
```
Impossible
```
