Evaluation: impossible incorrect

---

After analyzing the friendship connections among the eight individuals, we can observe that there exists a subset of five people—Bob, Fran, George, Heather, and Carol—who are all mutual friends. This forms a complete graph (clique) of five nodes, denoted as \( K_5 \). In graph coloring, a complete graph with \( n \) nodes requires at least \( n \) different colors to ensure that no two connected nodes share the same color.

Since \( K_5 \) necessitates five distinct colors and we are limited to only four colors (red, green, blue, yellow), it is impossible to assign colors to all eight individuals without violating the friendship constraint.

**Impossible**
