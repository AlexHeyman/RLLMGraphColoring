After analyzing the friendship relationships among Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, and Heather, it's clear that assigning one of four colors (Red, Green, Blue, or Yellow) to each person without any two friends sharing the same color is impossible. The high degree of interconnectedness, especially among Ethan, George, and Heather, creates constraints that cannot be satisfied with only four colors.

**Impossible**
