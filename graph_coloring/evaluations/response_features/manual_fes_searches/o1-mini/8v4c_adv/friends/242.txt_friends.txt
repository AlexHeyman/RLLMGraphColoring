After analyzing the friendship connections among the eight individuals, it's clear that assigning each person one of four colors—red, green, blue, or yellow—without any two friends wearing the same color is not feasible. The constraints imposed by the friendships create situations where all four colors are exhausted for certain individuals, making it impossible to find a valid assignment.
