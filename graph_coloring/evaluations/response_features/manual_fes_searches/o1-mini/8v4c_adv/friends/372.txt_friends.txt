Evaluation: impossible incorrect

---

After carefully analyzing the friendship relations and attempting various color assignments, it becomes clear that it's impossible to assign one of four colors to each person without violating the condition that no friends share the same color. Specifically, the presence of a complete subgraph (a group of four mutually friends) requires four distinct colors, which leaves no available color for additional friends without causing conflicts.
