We will show that no assignment of the four colors {Red, Green, Blue, Yellow} to the eight vertices (labeled 0 through 7) can avoid giving two endpoints of an edge the same color. (In other words, the graph does not have a proper 4–coloring.) After trying several “candidate” colorings we find that regardless of our approach one vertex – usually vertex 7, whose many neighbors “use up” all four colors – always ends up with no remaining color available.

To explain briefly one attempt (with some re–coloring in our search):

1. One idea is to “save” a color for vertex 7 by letting two of its neighbors share a color. For instance, notice that vertex 7 is adjacent to the vertices {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. (Its other neighbor is 0 from edge (0,7).) One might try to assign 0 and 1 the same color (say, Red). Then, for example, one assignment we attempted was

  0 Red  
  1 Red  
  2 Blue (since 2 is adjacent to 0 and 1, it can’t be Red)  
  3 Blue (since 3 is adjacent to 1, we try Blue, and note 2 and 3 are not adjacent so that is allowed)  
  4 Green (4 is adjacent to 0, 2, 3 so must differ from Red and Blue)  
  5 Yellow (5 is adjacent to 0, 1, 3, 4, so it cannot be Red, Blue, or Green)

Now, look at vertex 7. Its neighbors are 0 (Red), 1 (Red), 2 (Blue), 3 (Blue), 4 (Green), and 5 (Yellow). That collection exhausts all four colors even though Red and Blue appear twice. Thus vertex 7 would have no color available.
 
2. We tried many variations (changing which vertices get repeated colors among the neighbors of 7, switching the roles of the four colors, re–ordering the assignment on other vertices) and every time the heavy “saturation” of vertex 7’s neighborhood leaves no option for a legal color.

Because every attempt to color forces a “dead end” for at least one vertex (with vertex 7 the usual culprit), we conclude that a proper 4–coloring (a way to color every vertex in {Red, Green, Blue, Yellow} so that no two connected vertices share the same color) does not exist.

According to the directions, since it is impossible, the final output must simply be:

Impossible
