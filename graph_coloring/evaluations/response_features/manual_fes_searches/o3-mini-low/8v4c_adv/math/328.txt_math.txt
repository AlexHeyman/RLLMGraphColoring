We begin by listing the neighbors of each vertex based on the given edges:

• Vertex 0: neighbors {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7}  
• Vertex 1: neighbors {0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7}  
• Vertex 2: neighbors {0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7}  
• Vertex 3: neighbors {0, 1, 4, 6, 7}  
• Vertex 4: neighbors {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7}  
• Vertex 5: neighbors {0, 2, 4, 6, 7}  
• Vertex 6: neighbors {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7}  
• Vertex 7: neighbors {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

Notice that vertices 6 and 7 are connected to every other vertex. In addition, we see that the set {0, 1, 6, 7} forms a clique:  
– 0 is adjacent to 1, 6, and 7.  
– 1 is adjacent to 0, 6, and 7.  
– 6 is adjacent to 0, 1, and 7.  
– 7 is adjacent to 0, 1, and 6.

Since a clique requires all its vertices to receive different colors, those four vertices must use all four available colors (say Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow, in some order).

Now, consider vertex 2. Its neighbors are {0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7}. In particular, vertex 2 is adjacent to 0, 1, 6, and 7—the vertices of our four–vertex clique. This means that vertex 2 sees all four colors already assigned. With only four colors available, vertex 2 would have no valid color to use.

A similar problem occurs with vertex 3, which is adjacent to 0, 1, 6, and 7 as well.

Since at least one vertex (in fact, two vertices) cannot be colored without repeating a color, it is impossible to color this graph with four colors following the rule that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.
