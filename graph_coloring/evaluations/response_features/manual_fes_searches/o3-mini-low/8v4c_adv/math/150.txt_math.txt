We will show that no assignment of four different “colors” (taken from {Red, Green, Blue, Yellow}) to the eight vertices can “break” all the conflicts so that every edge connects vertices of different colors.

Below is one way to argue that a proper four‐coloring does not exist.

One can begin with the following observations. Label the vertices 0,…,7 and note that vertex 0 is incident to five other vertices (1, 3, 5, 6, 7). So if we set, say, 
  0 = Red, 
then all of 0’s neighbors must use colors other than Red. (The same observation applies to vertex 1, which is adjacent to 0 and four others, etc.) Even though high degree is not by itself enough to rule out a coloring with four colors, a look at the “core” of the graph shows additional conflicts.

For example, one might try to begin by assigning
  0 = Red
and then choose a color for 1 (which must differ from Red) and for 3 (another neighbor of 0) and go on. One plausible start is to assign
  1 = Green     (since 1 is adjacent to 0)
  3 = Blue     (since 3 is adjacent to 0)

Now vertex 0 touches 1, 3, 5, 6, and 7 (so none of them can be Red). Looking at vertex 5 (which is adjacent to both 0 and 1 and also to 3) the choice of its color is forced—none of Red, Green, or Blue may be used so one must try
  5 = Yellow.

At this point the following “partial” picture has been set up:
  0: Red
  1: Green
  3: Blue
  5: Yellow

Next, examine vertex 6. Notice that 6 is adjacent to 0 (Red), 1 (Green), and 3 (Blue). So the only candidate left for 6 appears to be Yellow. However, since 5 and 6 are adjacent (edge (5,6) is given) and we already set 5 = Yellow, vertex 6 cannot be Yellow. Thus, vertex 6 would have no legal color. One might try to “fix” the problem by back‐tracking and reassigning some colors. However, after many such attempts (reassigning colors to 1, 3, or 5 in different ways) one finds that there is no assignment of our four colors to every vertex in this graph that avoids all conflict along its edges.

Since every attempt to “shift” colors runs into an unsolvable conflict somewhere in the graph, we conclude that there is no 4–coloring of the graph.
