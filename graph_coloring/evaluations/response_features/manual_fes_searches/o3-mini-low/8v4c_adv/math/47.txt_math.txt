Notice that vertices 0 and 1 are not adjacent, so we might try giving them “different” colors and then use the two remaining colors for all of the vertices 2, 3, …, 7. However, every vertex among 2–7 is adjacent to both 0 and 1. That forces vertices 2–7 to be colored only with the two “left‐over” colors. In other words, the subgraph induced by vertices 2–7 must be 2–colorable (i.e. bipartite).

Carefully inspecting the edges among 2–7:
 • (2,5), (2,6), (2,7)
 • (3,5), (3,7)
 • (4,5), (4,6)
 • (5,6), (5,7)

One can verify that this induced subgraph contains an odd cycle. For example, consider the cycle 2–5–6–2: The edges (2,5) and (5,6) are present, and note that (2,6) is also an edge, so you can check several small cycles which prevent a proper 2–coloring. (In fact, even if you try other orders, the edge (5,6) “closes” the otherwise natural bipartite split.)

Since the vertices 2–7 cannot be colored with just two colors without a conflict, it is impossible to extend a 4–coloring to the whole graph (with 0 and 1 taking the other two colors) so that no adjacent vertices share the same color.

Thus the final answer is:

Impossible
