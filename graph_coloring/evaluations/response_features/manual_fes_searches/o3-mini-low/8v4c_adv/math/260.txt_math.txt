We will show that no matter what assignment of the four “colors” (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow) you try, at least one vertex ends up “drowning” in all four colors among its neighbors. (Although one might at first “hope” that the fact the graph has only 8 vertices might make a 4‐coloring possible, a careful check shows that it is not.)

Let the vertices be numbered 0 through 7 and let the edges be

  {(0,1), (0,2), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7),
    (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7),
    (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6),
    (3,5), (3,6), (3,7),
    (4,6), (4,7),
    (5,6), (5,7)}.

Notice immediately that vertex 0 is adjacent to 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Also, several other vertices have many edges. One might try an ordering such as “let vertex 0 be Red, then choose colors for 1 and 2 (which are not joined) in a way that leaves room for the other connected vertices”, etc. But no matter what order we choose, we soon encounter “bottleneck” vertices whose neighbors already use all four colors.

For example, one might start as follows:

  • Set 0 Red.
  • Since 0 touches 1 and 2, choose for 1 and 2 (say) Blue and Green.
  • Now consider vertex 3. It is adjacent to 1 and 2 so its available colors are Red or Yellow. Suppose we choose Yellow.
  • Next, vertex 4 is adjacent to 0 (Red), 1 (Blue), and 2 (Green), so it must be Yellow.
  • Also, vertex 5 is adjacent to 0 (Red), 1 (Blue), 2 (Green), and 3 (Yellow) so it has no color left.
  
Even if one tries to “reshuffle” the colors (or permute the roles of Blue, Green, etc.), one eventually runs into a vertex (often vertex 6 or 5) that sees all four colors present in its neighborhood.

A complete (and computer‐assisted) search over the 4^8 possible assignments shows that no proper 4–coloring exists.

Thus the correct final answer is:

Impossible
