Evaluation: impossible incorrect

Assigning four colors to the vertices so that every edge joins two differently colored vertices appears to be impossible on this graph. (One way to see this is by noticing that vertex 6 is adjacent to six other vertices. In any four‐coloring, the other six vertices must use only four colors and—because many of them are mutually adjacent—they “use up” all four colors on the neighbors of 6, leaving no available color for vertex 6.)
