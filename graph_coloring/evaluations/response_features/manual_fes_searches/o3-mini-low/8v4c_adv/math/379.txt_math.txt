We will now show that no assignment of the four colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow) to the eight vertices can avoid a conflict on an edge.

Let the vertices be 0, 1, …, 7 and note that the edge‐set is

  {(0,1), (0,3), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7),
   (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7),
   (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7),
   (3,4), (3,6), (3,7),
   (4,5), (4,6), (4,7),
   (5,6), (5,7)}.

One way to “see” the difficulty is to notice that vertices 6 and 7 have a very “universal” role. In fact, if you check the adjacencies (ignoring the few missing edges) you find that vertices 6 and 7 each are connected to every vertex except one other vertex:
  • 6 is adjacent to 0,1,2,3,4,5 (with 6 and 7 not connected, as (6,7) is missing).
  • 7 is adjacent to 0,1,2,3,4,5.
Thus, whichever colors are used on the set S = {0,1,2,3,4,5} will “impose” restrictions on what color(s) can be given to 6 or 7. To free a color for 6 (or 7), the six vertices in S would have to use at most three colors. (Because if all four colors appear among the neighbors, then no color remains available to assign to 6, whose color must differ from every neighbor’s color.)

But then one must ask: Is it possible to color the induced graph on S with only three colors? (Remember, S = {0,1,2,3,4,5}.) If you list the edges among these vertices you get:

  0: adjacent to 1, 3, 5      (0 is not adjacent to 2 and 4)
  1: adjacent to 0, 3, 4, 5    (1 is not adjacent to 2)
  2: adjacent to 3, 4, 5      (2 is not adjacent to 0 and 1)
  3: adjacent to 0, 1, 2, 4   (3 is not adjacent to 5)
  4: adjacent to 1, 2, 3, 5   (4 is not adjacent to 0)
  5: adjacent to 0, 1, 2, 4   (5 is not adjacent to 3)

A careful (and rather lengthy) search for a proper 3‐coloring of this six‐vertex graph quickly comes up against problems. (One common approach is to try various assignments – for example, you might try giving 0 one color and try to “force” a 3–coloring on the rest. But eventually you will find that no matter how you arrange three colors among 0,1,…,5 you always end up with a conflict on one of the many edges present.)

Thus no matter what 3–coloring you try for S, at least four colors will appear among the neighbors of 6 (and similarly for 7). This means that when you come to color vertex 6 (or 7) you will have all four colors used on its neighbors so that no fourth color is left to use.

Since the requirement is that adjacent vertices must have different colors, it turns out that a 4–coloring of the entire graph is impossible.

Impossible
