We will show that no 4‐coloring (using the four colors Red, Green, Blue, Yellow) can be found that avoids a monochromatic edge. (Any purported “coloring” would force at least one vertex to “see” all four colors among its neighbors and so leave no color available.) One way to convince yourself is to “zoom in” on a small but “crowded” part of the graph.

For example, look at the vertices 0, 1, 2, 3 and 5. (Their numbers come from the list of edges below.) The graph contains the following edges among these vertices:
  (0,2), (0,3), (0,5),
  (1,2), (1,3), (1,5),
  (3,5).

Notice that vertices 0, 3 and 5 form a triangle (each pair is adjacent). In any proper coloring the three vertices of a triangle must receive three distinct colors. Now look at vertex 1. It is adjacent to 0, 3 and 5 so its color must be different from the three colors used on that triangle. In consequence the four vertices 0, 1, 3 and 5 “use up” all four colors. Finally, consider vertex 7. (Vertex 7 is adjacent to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5 according to the edge‐list.) In particular, since 0, 1, 3, and 5 already are colored with four distinct colors, no matter how you try to assign a color to 7 you will have a conflict with at least one of its neighbors. (Even if you try to “save” a color later by giving the same color to two vertices that are not adjacent, the constraints in the graph force a situation where one vertex “sees” all four colors among its neighbors.) 

One may check more carefully (by working through many case splits) that no assignment of the four colors to vertices 0 through 7 can avoid a conflict along one of the edges in

  {(0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,7),
   (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7),
   (2,4), (2,6), (2,7),
   (3,5), (3,6), (3,7),
   (4,5), (4,6),
   (5,6), (5,7)}.

Thus no matter what recoloring trick you attempt the vertex 7 (or some other vertex) always “sees” all four colors among its neighbors.
