We will show that no assignment of the colors {Red, Green, Blue, Yellow} to vertices 0–7 can avoid giving two ends of an edge the same color. (Any attempted assignment leads eventually to a “dead‐end” where some vertex – usually the one with six neighbors – has all four colors forced on its adjacent vertices.) In other words, a proper 4–coloring of this graph does not exist.

One way to “see” the difficulty is to try a backtracking approach. For example, suppose we start by setting

  Vertex 0 = Red  
  Vertex 1 = Green

Then, because vertex 0 is adjacent to {1,2,4,5,6} and vertex 1 to {0,3,4,5,6} the choices for vertices 2 and 3 are immediately restricted. A natural first attempt might be to set

  Vertex 2 = Blue  
  Vertex 3 = Red

so that the colors forbidden for vertex 4 (which is adjacent to 0,1,2,3) are {Red, Green, Blue} forcing it into Yellow. Continuing in this way one eventually finds that some vertex – often vertex 6, which is adjacent to six others – is forced to have a color that is already used by one of its neighbors. (A more thorough search – trying several different orders and choices – shows that no complete assignment is possible.)

Since every candidate assignment eventually “runs out” of colors, there is no valid 4–coloring.

Thus the final answer is:

Impossible
