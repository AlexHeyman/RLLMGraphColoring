We'll show that despite our best attempts a proper 4‐coloring is not possible. In other words, if we insist on assigning one of “Red”, “Green”, “Blue”, or “Yellow” to every vertex while making sure that any two vertices joined by an edge get different colors, we eventually run into a conflict. (More formally, one may prove that the graph’s structure forces a “5–clique” if we try to use only four colors, which is impossible.)

For example, one natural approach is:
 • Pick vertex 0 and assign Red.
 • Since 0 is adjacent to vertices 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, none of those may be Red.
 • Suppose we assign vertex 1 = Green.
 • Then for vertex 2 (which is adjacent to 1) we might try Blue.
 • Vertex 3, adjacent to 0 (Red), 1 (Green) and 2 (Blue) must then be Yellow.
 • Similarly vertex 4 (adjacent to 0, 1, and 2) must be assigned Yellow.
 • Next consider vertex 5. It is adjacent to 0 (Red), 2 (Blue), 3 (Yellow), and 4 (Yellow) so the only possibility left is Green.
 • Finally vertex 6 is adjacent to 0 (Red), 2 (Blue), 3 (Yellow), 4 (Yellow) and 5 (Green); no available color remains.

One might try to rearrange the choices by changing the order or the alternative color assignments, but no matter how one arranges things, the high connectivity of the graph forces a point where a vertex is surrounded by neighbors using up all four colors.

Thus, a proper 4‐coloring of the graph is impossible.
