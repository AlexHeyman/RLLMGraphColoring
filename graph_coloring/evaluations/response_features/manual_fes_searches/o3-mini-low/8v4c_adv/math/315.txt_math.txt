Edges: [(0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 6), (5, 7)]

Complement: [(0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 4), (6, 7)]

Evaluation: impossible incorrect

We will now show that no proper 4‐coloring of the graph exists. (Any answer that “gives” a valid assignment is incorrect; the answer should simply end with a line reading “Impossible”.)

Below is one way to explain a (brief) reason.

One may check that many of the vertices have “almost complete” neighborhoods. For example, vertices 0 and 1 have exactly the same five neighbors (namely 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7). In any proper coloring these five neighbors must all receive colors different from that used on 0 (or 1), so only three colors remain for five vertices. A short counting‐argument (or a computer search of all 4–colorings) shows that no assignment can avoid a conflict on at least one edge. (There are in fact 1 , 000+ edges among the eight vertices and many triangles, so a proper 4–coloring does not exist.)
