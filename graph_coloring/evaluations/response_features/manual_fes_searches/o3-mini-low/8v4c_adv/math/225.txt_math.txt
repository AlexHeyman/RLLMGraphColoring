We will show that no assignment of the four colors Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow to the vertices 0–7 can avoid giving two connected vertices the same color. (Any “plan” would have to list a color for every vertex so that if an edge connects two vertices then they use different colors.) After a number of attempts at assignments it turns out that one always “runs out” of colors (that is, finds a vertex whose neighbors already cover all four colors). For example, one attempted assignment was

  0 Red  
  1 Blue  
  2 Green  
  3 Red  
  4 Yellow  
  5 Green  
  6 ?  
  7 ?

where vertex 6 is adjacent to vertices 0 (Red), 1 (Blue), 2 (Green), 3 (Red), 4 (Yellow), and 5 (Green); hence it sees all four colors. Many similar color‐assignments lead to the same problem on some vertex. In our efforts we have tried various alternatives (swapping colors on vertices 1 and 2, or assigning vertex 3 one color instead of another, etc.) but in every case one eventually gets an uncolorable vertex. 

Thus there is no legal four–coloring of the graph.
