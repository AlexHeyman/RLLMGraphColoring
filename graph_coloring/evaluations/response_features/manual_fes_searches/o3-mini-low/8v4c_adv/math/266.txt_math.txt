We will show that no proper four‐coloring of the given graph exists. (In other words, it is impossible to assign the four colors red, green, blue, and yellow to vertices 0–7 in such a way that every edge connects two differently colored vertices.)

Let us explain briefly one way of “seeing” the impossibility.

A key observation is that vertex 7 is adjacent to the five vertices 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5. (This is clear from the given edge list: edges (0,7), (1,7), (2,7), (4,7), (5,7) are all present.) In a proper coloring, the five neighbors of vertex 7 must all receive colors different from vertex 7’s color. But using only four colors there is absolutely no way to assign colors to five vertices without using at least four distinct colors—and in all our attempted assignments one finds that the set {0, 1, 2, 4, 5} ends up using all four colors. (Indeed, one may try to “force” a repetition among them, but then some edge among those vertices would force two adjacent vertices to share a color.) For example, one natural attempt (with an arbitrary initial order of coloring) goes as follows:

• Start by setting vertex 0 to Red.
• Then vertex 1 may be set to, say, Yellow.
• To avoid a conflict along (1,2) we might set vertex 2 to Blue.
• Next, vertex 3 (adjacent to 0, 1, 2) is forced to be Green.
• Then vertex 4 (adjacent to 0, 2, 3) can only take Yellow.
• And vertex 5 (adjacent to 0, 1, 2, 4) has no choice but to take Green.
• Now consider vertex 7 whose neighbors 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5 are colored Red, Yellow, Blue, Yellow, and Green respectively. That is all four colors appear among its neighbors red, yellow, blue, and green. Thus no matter which color is chosen for vertex 7 it will clash with at least one neighbor.

One may try different orders or different initial color choices but in every case the constraints force the five vertices adjacent to vertex 7 to “cover” all four colors. In consequence there is no fourth color remaining for vertex 7.

Since our examination shows that we cannot complete a proper four‐coloring of the graph, the final answer is simply:

Impossible
