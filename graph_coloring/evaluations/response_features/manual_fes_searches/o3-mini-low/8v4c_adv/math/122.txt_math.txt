Let's look at the situation. Notice that vertices 2, 3, 4, and 6 form a clique (each is connected to every other: (2,3), (2,4), (2,6), (3,4), (3,6), (4,6) are all present). This means that these four vertices must all receive different colors. Now observe vertex 0. Its neighbors are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 â€“ and in particular, it is adjacent to the clique members 2, 3, 4, and 6 which by necessity use all four colors. Thus, no matter how we assign colors to the clique, vertex 0 will be forced to be adjacent to a vertex of every one of the four colors. Therefore, there is no color left for vertex 0.

Since even one vertex cannot be colored properly with 4 colors, the task is impossible.
