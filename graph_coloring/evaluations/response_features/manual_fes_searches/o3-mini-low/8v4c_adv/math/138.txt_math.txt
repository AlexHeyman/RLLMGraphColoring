We will show that no matter how we try to assign four colors, one vertex (namely vertex 6) ends up “trapped” because it is adjacent to vertices covering all 4 colors.

Let’s sketch an argument.

Step 1. Notice the following edges:
 • Vertex 0 is connected to 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
 • Vertex 1 is connected to 0, 2, 4, 6, and 7.
 • Vertex 4 is connected to 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7.
 • Vertex 7 is connected to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

Thus, the four vertices 0, 1, 4, and 7 form a clique; that is, every pair of these vertices is connected by an edge. In any proper coloring these four must receive four different colors. For concreteness, suppose
  0 → Red
  1 → Green
  4 → Blue
  7 → Yellow

Step 2. Now consider vertex 6. Its list of neighbors (given by the edge list) is:
  6 is adjacent to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7.
That means 6 is adjacent to vertices with colors Red (vertex 0), Green (vertex 1), Blue (vertex 4), and Yellow (vertex 7). Even if the other two neighbors (vertices 2 and 3) might repeat one of these colors, vertex 6 already “sees” all four colors in its neighborhood.

Step 3. Since vertex 6 is adjacent to four vertices with different colors, there is no color left among Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow that can be given to 6. Hence no proper 4‐coloring exists.

We conclude that it is impossible to color every vertex with red, green, blue, or yellow so that no two adjacent vertices receive the same color.
