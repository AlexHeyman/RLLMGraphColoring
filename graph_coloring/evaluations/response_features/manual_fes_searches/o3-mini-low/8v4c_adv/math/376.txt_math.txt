We will show that no assignment of four “colors” (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow) to the eight vertices (0–7) is possible so that every edge joins two vertices of different colors. (Any purported coloring will force at least one vertex to have all four colors already used among its neighbors.) 

Below is one way to argue that no valid 4‐coloring exists.

Step 1. Note that vertices 0 and 1 are each adjacent to every vertex in the set {2,3,4,5,6,7} but not adjacent to one another. (Thus 0 and 1 could in principle share a color.) However, because each vertex in {2,…,7} is adjacent to both 0 and 1 the “available list” (colors not allowed by 0 and 1) for each of these vertices is reduced right away.

Step 2. In any 4–coloring one might try to “save” colors by letting 0 and 1 have the same color; say Red. Then every vertex in {2,3,4,5,6,7} must be chosen from {Green, Blue, Yellow}. (Three choices available for six vertices.) 

Step 3. Beyond the edges from 0 and 1, the graph has many extra edges among the vertices 2 … 7. For example, the edge set includes (2,4), (2,6), (2,7), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), and (5,6), (5,7). An attempted assignment quickly runs into trouble. (For example, one might try assigning 2 Green, 3 Green, 4 Blue and 5 Yellow – but then considering the neighbors of vertex 6, which is adjacent to 0 (Red), 1 (Red), 2 (Green), 3 (Green), 4 (Blue) and 5 (Yellow), one sees that every one of the three colors other than Red is used. Hence vertex 6 would have no legal color.) 

Step 4. One can try re–arranging the assignments (even allowing 0 and 1 to receive different colors) but it turns out that whichever case one considers, at least one vertex (typically one of 4, 5, 6, or 7) ends up “overconstrained” – that is, with all four colors forced among its neighbors.

Conclusion. Because every attempt to assign colors to the vertices meeting the condition “neighbors get different colors” runs into a contradiction, there is no valid assignment.

Thus the answer is:

Impossible
