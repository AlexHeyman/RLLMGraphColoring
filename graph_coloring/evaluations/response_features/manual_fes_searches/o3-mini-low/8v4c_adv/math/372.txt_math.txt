We will show that if vertex 0 is given one of the four colors then every other vertex (vertices 1 through 7) is forced to avoid that color. In other words, all the vertices 1–7 must be colored using only the remaining three colors. However, a look at the induced subgraph on vertices 1–7 reveals that it contains a clique (a set of mutually adjacent vertices) of size 4. (For example, the vertices 1, 2, 4, and 7 form a clique because every pair among them is adjacent.) A clique of size 4 requires at least 4 different colors, but we would only have the 3 colors available (since the color used for vertex 0 is forbidden on every one of these vertices). This is a contradiction.

Thus, it is impossible to color the graph with four colors so that no two adjacent vertices receive the same color.
