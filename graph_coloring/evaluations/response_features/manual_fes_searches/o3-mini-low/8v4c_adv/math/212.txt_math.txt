The key observation is that the graph contains a clique of 5 vertices. In fact, if you look at vertices 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, you’ll notice that every distinct pair among these is connected by an edge. A complete graph (clique) on 5 vertices, K₅, requires 5 different colors in any proper vertex‐coloring (where no two adjacent vertices get the same color). Since we only have 4 colors available (red, green, blue, and yellow), it is impossible to color the graph properly.
