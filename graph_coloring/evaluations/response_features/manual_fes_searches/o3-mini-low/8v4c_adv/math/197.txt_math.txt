We will show that no matter how we try, with the four available colors (Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow) it is not possible to assign colors to all eight vertices so that adjacent vertices receive different colors.

Let the vertices be 0,…,7 and note that vertex 0 is adjacent to every other vertex. Thus if we assign vertex 0 a color (say, Red), then vertices 1 through 7 must be colored using only the other three colors (Green, Blue, Yellow). In other words, the seven‐vertex “peripheral” subgraph induced on 1,…,7 would have to be three–colorable.

One may try to “three–color” that induced subgraph (whose edges are given by
  {(1,2), (1,3), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (2,6), (2,7), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7)}).
A fairly lengthy search for an assignment meeting the constraints – for example by starting with vertex 1 and trying assignments for vertices 2, 3, etc. – shows that there is no way to color vertices 1,…,7 with only three colors so that every edge connects vertices of different colors. In every attempt some vertex ends up having all three candidate colors forbidden by its already–colored neighbors.

Because of vertex0’s “universal” connections and the extra edges among the other vertices, the only hope was to “save” a color by using red on a peripheral vertex. But vertex0 is adjacent to all others so no peripheral vertex may share its color.

Thus the coloring problem is unsolvable with the given four colors.
