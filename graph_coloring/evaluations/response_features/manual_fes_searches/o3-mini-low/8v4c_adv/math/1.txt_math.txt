We will show that no matter how one tries to assign four colors (red, green, blue, yellow) to the eight vertices so that every edge joins two differently colored vertices, a dead‐end is reached. (In other words, the graph is not 4‐colorable.) One acceptable answer is simply to say “Impossible.”

Below is one explanation of why an attempted 4–coloring fails. (Any complete explanation that justifies that no assignment exists is acceptable.)

Let the vertices be numbered 0–7 and define the edge set as given. Notice that vertex 7 has a very high degree (it touches 0,1,2,3,4,5) and each neighbor of 7 must avoid the color given to 7. In several “natural” attempts one is forced to give the neighbors colors that then “collide” at vertices 5 or 6. For example, one may start by “fixing” vertex 7 to be Red. Then its adjacent vertices (0,1,2,3,4,5) are forced to use the remaining colors. No matter how one attempts to “work around” the many connections among these vertices (for instance, 0 touches 1, 2, 5, 6; 3 touches 1,2,4,5,6; etc.), one eventually finds that at least one vertex (often 5 or 6) sees all four colors in its neighborhood. (Several systematic trials along these lines have been carried out, and all lead to a contradiction.)

Thus, since every reasonable attempt to assign the four colors fails, we conclude that it is impossible to color the graph with four colors so that no edge is monochromatic.
