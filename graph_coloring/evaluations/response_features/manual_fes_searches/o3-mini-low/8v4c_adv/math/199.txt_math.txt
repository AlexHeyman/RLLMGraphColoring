After careful analysis it turns out that no valid 4‐coloring exists for this graph.

One way to see the problem is to focus on vertex 5. Its neighbors are

 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7

and the graph’s edges force many adjacencies among these vertices. In any proper coloring their colors “spill over” into so many of the four available colors that no color remains available for vertex 5. For example, many attempted assignments (by starting with 0 and 1 and then choosing colors for 2,3,4, etc.) eventually force vertices 0,1,2,3,4 to use all four colors amongst themselves. Since 5 is adjacent to all of them, there is no valid color left for vertex 5.

Thus, the desired 4‐coloring of the graph is impossible.

Impossible
