We will show that no assignment of four colors (red, green, blue, yellow) to the vertices exists that would “properly” color the graph—that is, such that every edge connects two differently colored vertices.

One way to arrive at this answer is by “attempting” to color the vertices and then finding a vertex that is forced to have all four different colors among its neighbors.

For example, label the vertices 0,…,7 and suppose we try the following initial assignments:
 • Let vertex 0 be Red.
 • Since 0 is adjacent to 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, none of those six vertices can be Red.
 • Then pick some color for vertex 1 (say Green) and for vertex 2 (which is adjacent to 1, among others) a color like Blue.
 • Continuing in this way we must “choose” a color for vertex 4 (which is adjacent to 0 (Red), 1 (Green) and 2 (Blue)) that is Yellow.
 • Then, moving on, vertex 5 (adjacent to 0 (Red), 3 and 4 (Yellow)) might be assigned (say) Green.
 • But then vertex 6 is adjacent to 0 (Red), 1 (Green), 2 (Blue), 4 (Yellow) and 5 (Green) so its neighbors already use all four colors.

One may try different choices and even reorder the vertices, but the same obstruction is encountered. One “corner” of the graph forces a vertex (here vertex 6) to have a neighborhood whose vertices use all four colors. (Indeed, vertex 0 is adjacent to 1,3,4,5,6,7; then 1 is adjacent to 2, and extra edges tie 2, 4, 6, 7 into a nearly complete subgraph on four vertices so that when you set 0’s color the rest must avoid it. In the end one vertex – typically vertex 6 – ends up “trapped.”)

Because every attempt leads to such a contradiction, it is impossible to color the vertices with only 4 colors so that adjacent ones get different colors.
