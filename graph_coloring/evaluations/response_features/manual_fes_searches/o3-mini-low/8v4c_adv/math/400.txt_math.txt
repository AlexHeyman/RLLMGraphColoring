We will show that a proper 4‐coloring (using the colors Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow) for the given graph is impossible. Here is an outline of the reasoning:

1. Notice that vertices 0 and 1 are “special” because every edge given includes either 0 or 1 in connection with all of the vertices 2,…,7. In fact, every edge incident with any vertex among 2,…,7 is also incident with both 0 and 1. (For example, (0,2) and (1,2) are present.) Thus every vertex from 2 to 7 is adjacent to both 0 and 1.

2. Since adjacent vertices must have different colors, vertices 0 and 1 must receive two distinct colors. Without loss of generality, assume we assign:
  0 → Red
  1 → Green

3. Now consider any vertex v in {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}. Because v is adjacent to both 0 and 1, it may not be colored Red or Green. So each of these vertices has only two available colors – Blue and Yellow.

4. In other words, the subgraph induced by vertices {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} would have to be 2–colored (with Blue and Yellow) in order to extend the 4–coloring to the entire graph. However, if you inspect the set of edges among vertices 2–7 the following edges are present:
  (2,5), (2,6), (2,7),
  (3,4), (3,6), (3,7),
  (4,5), (4,6), (4,7),
  (5,6), (5,7).

5. One may try to partition vertices 2–7 into two color classes (say, Blue and Yellow). But a short analysis shows that the resulting graph is not bipartite. For instance, note that the cycle 2–6–4–5–2 is a 4–cycle which by itself is even; however, a more careful attempt to assign Blue/Yellow consistently (beginning with 2 Blue forces 5,6,7 to Yellow, then working through the other edges) runs into contradictions. (A systematic check shows that there is no way to assign just two colors, Blue and Yellow, to vertices 2–7 so that every edge among them connects vertices of different colors.)

6. Since the vertices 2–7 have no possibility of using Red or Green (because they are each adjacent to both vertex 0 which is Red and vertex 1 which is Green), and since the available two colors (Blue and Yellow) are insufficient to color the non–bipartite induced subgraph on vertices 2–7, there is no valid 4–coloring of the entire graph.

Thus, the answer is:

Impossible
