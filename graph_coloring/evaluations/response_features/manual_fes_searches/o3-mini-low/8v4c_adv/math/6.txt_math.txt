Edges: [(0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 7), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7)]

Complement: [(0, 1), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 6), (4, 7), (6, 7)]

Evaluation: impossible incorrect

The answer is:

Impossible

After much trial we eventually can’t assign four colors to vertices 0–7 so that every edge joins vertices of different colors. Every attempt using Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow ends up “trapping” one vertex with all four colors already forbidden by its neighbors. Thus no valid four‐color assignment exists.
