We will show that no proper 4‐coloring of the vertices is possible.

To explain briefly, note that the vertex labeled 4 is adjacent to every other vertex. (Its neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7.) That forces vertex 4 to “steal” one of the four available colors and require that every other vertex receive one of the remaining three colors. However, if you look at the subgraph induced by {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7}, you’ll notice it is “almost complete” – many pairs are adjacent. In fact, one may check that there is a clique of size 4 in that subgraph (for example the set {0, 1, 6, 7} forms a clique since every two of these vertices are joined by an edge). A clique of size 4 requires four distinct colors. But if we had to color all the vertices other than vertex 4 with only three colors (because vertex 4 uses the fourth) then a clique of size 4 in that set would be impossible to color.

In short, since vertex 4 is adjacent to all others, the remaining seven vertices would have to be colored with three colors. But they contain a clique on 4 vertices that by its nature needs 4 colors, so no valid 4‐coloring exists.

Thus, the final answer is:

Impossible
