Evaluation: impossible incorrect

Notice that vertex 2 is adjacent to five other vertices—namely, vertices 0, 1, 5, 6, and 7. Since we only have four colors available, even in the best‐case scenario the five neighbors of vertex 2 must receive at least five colors if they were to all be distinct. (And indeed, because many of these vertices are mutually adjacent as well, there is no “sharing” of colors available.) Thus there is no way to avoid a conflict on vertex 2.
