We will show that no matter how you try to assign the four colors to vertices 0–7 (where “colors” are Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow) while avoiding giving the same color to two endpoints of any edge, you will always run into a conflict. (Any correct procedure—even if done by computer search—shows that a proper 4‐coloring is impossible.)

Below is one way to explain a failed attempt. (Any systematic backtracking – for example, assuming vertex 0 is Red – eventually “hits a wall.”)

For example, suppose we start with an arbitrary assignment:
  • Set vertex 0 = Red.
  • Since 0 is adjacent to 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7, none of these may be Red.
  • Set vertex 1 = Green.
Now one might try:
  • Set vertex 2 = Blue.
  • Set vertex 3 = Green (it cannot be Red or Blue because of its neighbors 0 and 2).
  • Then vertex 4 is adjacent to vertices 0 (Red), 1 (Green), and 3 (Green) so one might choose Blue for vertex 4.
  • Next, vertex 5 is adjacent to 1 (Green), 2 (Blue), 3 (Green), and 4 (Blue) so vertex 5 must be Red.
  • Vertex 6 sees neighbors 0 (Red), 1 (Green), 2 (Blue), 3 (Green), 4 (Blue), and 5 (Red) so its only “free” option would be Yellow.
  • Finally, vertex 7 is adjacent to 0 (Red), 1 (Green), 2 (Blue), 3 (Green), 4 (Blue), 5 (Red), and 6 (Yellow) – so no color remains.

One might try changing one or two choices as one backtracks, but a careful examination (by hand or by computer‐assisted search) shows that every possible assignment runs into a similar conflict.

Thus the answer is:

Impossible
