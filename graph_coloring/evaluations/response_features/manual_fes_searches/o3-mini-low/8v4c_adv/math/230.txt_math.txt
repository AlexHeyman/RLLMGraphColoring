We will show that no proper 4‐coloring exists. In other words, it is impossible to assign each vertex one of the colors Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow so that every edge connects two vertices of different colors.

Let’s explain one way to see the impossibility.

Observe first the following about the graph. Its vertices are 0,…,7 and many pairs are adjacent. In fact, if you list the neighbors from the given edge set you find:

 • Vertex 0 is adjacent to 3, 5, 6, 7.
 • Vertex 1 is adjacent to 2, 3, 4, 6, 7.
 • Vertex 2 is adjacent to 1, 4, 5, 6, 7.
 • Vertex 3 is adjacent to 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7.
 • Vertex 4 is adjacent to 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7.
 • Vertex 5 is adjacent to 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7.
 • Vertex 6 is adjacent to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
 • Vertex 7 is adjacent to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

Notice that vertices 6 and 7 are “central” in the sense that each is adjacent to all of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Therefore when it comes time to color vertices 6 and 7 the following must hold: Whatever colors are used on vertices 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 (in a proper coloring of the induced subgraph on these six vertices) must leave at least one color “unused” among {Red, Green, Blue, Yellow} so that each of 6 and 7 can be assigned that extra color. (Since by definition a vertex must get a color different from every one of its neighbors.) 

One may check by examining the induced subgraph on vertices 0–5 (whose edges are:
 (0,3), (0,5), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)) that a proper 3‐coloring of these 6 vertices is in fact possible. For example, one valid 3–coloring of vertices 0–5 with colors {Red, Green, Blue} is:

 0: Red  
 1: Blue  
 2: Green  
 3: Green  
 4: Red  
 5: Blue  

One can verify that every given edge among vertices 0–5 connects two different colors. However, note that the set {Red, Blue, Green} is then “exhausted” on the neighbors of both 6 and 7. That is, each of vertices 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 uses one of the three colors Red, Green, or Blue. So when you come to vertex 6—which is adjacent to all six of these vertices—it cannot be colored Red, Blue, or Green; hence it must be colored Yellow.

Similarly, vertex 7 is also adjacent to all of vertices 0–5. Thus vertex 7 also “sees” Red, Blue, and Green on its neighbors and must be colored Yellow. But the original graph contains the edge (6,7); that is, vertices 6 and 7 are adjacent. This immediately forces a conflict (both would be Yellow).

Since no alternate assignment over the six vertices can leave two different “free” colors for 6 and 7 (they always “steal” the entire set of three colors from 0–5) the task is impossible.

Thus the final answer is:

Impossible
