Notice that the friendships among the 8 people form a graph, and the condition is that no two friends may wear shirts of the same color. In other words, we need to color the vertices of the graph with 4 colors (red, green, blue, yellow) so that adjacent vertices receive different colors.

Closer inspection of the friendships shows that there is a set of 5 people—namely, Alice, Carol, Fran, George, and Heather—that are all pairwise friends. For example, the information tells us:
 • Alice is friends with Carol, Fran, George, and Heather.
 • Carol is friends with Alice, Fran, George, and Heather.
 • Fran is friends with Alice, Carol, George, and Heather.
 • George is friends with Alice, Carol, Fran, and Heather.
 • Heather is friends with Alice, Carol, Fran, and George.

This set of 5 forms a complete subgraph (a clique of size 5). In any clique of size n, all vertices are adjacent to each other, which forces the use of n different colors. Here, with 5 people all mutually adjacent, you would need 5 colors. Since only 4 colors are available, it is impossible to assign a shirt color to each person without having at least one pair of friends share the same color.

Closer inspection of the friendships shows that there is a set of 5 people—namely, #0, #2, #5, #6, and #7—that are all pairwise friends. For example, the information tells us:
 • #0 is friends with #2, #5, #6, and #7.
 • #2 is friends with #0, #5, #6, and #7.
 • #5 is friends with #0, #2, #6, and #7.
 • #6 is friends with #0, #2, #5, and #7.
 • #7 is friends with #0, #2, #5, and #6.
