We can show that no valid shirt‐coloring is possible. One way to see this is to notice that in the friendship graph there is a clique (a group of people all mutually friends) of size 5. In particular, consider Carol, Dave, Ethan, George, and Heather. Checking the given relationships:

• Carol is friends with Dave, Ethan, George, and Heather.
• Dave is friends with Ethan, George, and Heather.
• Ethan is friends with George and Heather.
• George is friends with Heather.

Thus every pair among {Carol, Dave, Ethan, George, Heather} is friends. In a clique, all the people must have different colors, so these five people would have to wear five different colored shirts. However, only four shirt colors (red, green, blue, yellow) are available. Because five different colors would be required, there is no way to assign one of the four colors to every one of the 8 people without creating a conflict between some friends.

Therefore, the answer is:

Impossible
