One way to determine the answer is to try to assign colors systematically. For example, label the people A (Alice), B (Bob), C (Carol), D (Dave), E (Ethan), F (Fran), G (George), and H (Heather).

From the friendship list we have:
• A is friends with everyone else (B, C, D, E, F, G, H).
• B is friends with A, D, E, F, G, H.
• C is friends with A, D, E, F, G, H.
• D is friends with A, B, C, E, G, H.
• E is friends with A, B, C, D, F (since Dave is friends with Ethan and Ethan is friends with Fran).
• F is friends with A, B, C, E, G, H (in addition to the link noted with E, and also with George and Heather).
• G is friends with A, B, C, D, F.
• H is friends with A, B, C, D, F.

Notice that A is connected to everyone. Suppose we try to assign A a color, say Red. Then nobody else can wear Red. Continuing, if we try to assign different colors to B, C, and D—say Green, Blue, and Yellow respectively—we soon run into a problem with E. Since E is friends with A, B, C, and D, it cannot use Red, Green, Blue, or Yellow. 

There is no fourth color available for E. Therefore, with only four colors available, it is impossible to assign a color to each person so that no two friends wear the same shirt color.
