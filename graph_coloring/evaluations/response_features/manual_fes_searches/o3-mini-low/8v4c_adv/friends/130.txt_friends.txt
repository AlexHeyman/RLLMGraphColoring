We will show that by looking carefully at the friendship relationships one may identify a set of 5 people all pair‐wise friends – which forces any “proper” assignment (one in which no two friends share the same shirt color) to use at least 5 different colors. Since only 4 colors are available, a valid assignment is impossible.

Let’s explain.

List the eight people and their friends (each friendship is bidirectional):

• Alice is friends with Bob, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather.
• Bob is friends with Alice, Carol, Dave, Ethan, George, Heather.
• Carol is friends with Bob, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather.
• Dave is friends with Bob, Carol, Ethan, Fran.
• Ethan is friends with Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Fran, George, Heather.
• Fran is friends with Alice, Carol, Dave, Ethan, George.
• George is friends with Alice, Bob, Carol, Ethan, Fran, Heather.
• Heather is friends with Alice, Bob, Carol, Ethan, George.

Now, consider the following five people: Bob, Carol, Ethan, George, and Heather. Check that each pair among these five are friends:

1. Bob – Carol: given.
2. Bob – Ethan: given.
3. Bob – George: given.
4. Bob – Heather: given.
5. Carol – Ethan: given.
6. Carol – George: given.
7. Carol – Heather: given.
8. Ethan – George: given.
9. Ethan – Heather: given.
10. George – Heather: given.

All possible pairs appear in the friendship list. Thus, these five people form a clique (complete subgraph) of 5 participants. In any valid coloring of a graph, a clique with 5 vertices requires 5 different colors because every vertex in a clique is adjacent to every other vertex. Since we only have 4 colors available, it is impossible to color (i.e. assign shirt colors to) these five individuals without having two friends wearing the same color.

Therefore, no assignment exists.

Impossible
