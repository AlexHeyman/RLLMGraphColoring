We will show that no matter how one tries to assign the four colors to the eight people under the rule “no friends may wear the same colored shirt,” a conflict is unavoidable. (In graph‐theoretic language, the “friendship graph” here has chromatic number 5, so it cannot be 4–colored.)

One way to see this is to note that Heather is friends with seven people (everyone except Bob) and many of those friends, in turn, are all mutually interconnected. For example, consider the set {Alice, Carol, Dave, George, Heather}. Checking the list we see that

  • Alice is friends with (at least) Carol, Dave, George, and Heather.
  • Carol is friends with Alice, Dave, George, and Heather.
  • Dave is friends with Alice, Carol, George, and Heather.
  • George is friends with Alice, Carol, Dave, and Heather.
  • Heather is friends with everyone in the set.

Thus these five form a clique (a complete subgraph where every two vertices are adjacent). In any clique of size n, you must use n different colors. (You can verify that no two people in the set can wear the same color because they are friends.) Since n = 5 here, it is impossible to assign only four colors without forcing two people who are friends to wear the same color.

Because of this unavoidable conflict, it is impossible for all eight people to choose from only the four colors without a clash.

One way to see this is to note that #7 is friends with seven people (everyone except #1) and many of those friends, in turn, are all mutually interconnected. For example, consider the set {#0, #2, #3, #6, #7}. Checking the list we see that

  • #0 is friends with (at least) #2, #3, #6, and #7.
  • #2 is friends with #0, #3, #6, and #7.
  • #3 is friends with #0, #2, #6, and #7.
