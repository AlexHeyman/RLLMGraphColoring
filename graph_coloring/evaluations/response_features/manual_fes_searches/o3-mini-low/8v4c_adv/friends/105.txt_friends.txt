We will show that no valid assignment is possible. One way to see this is to note that by looking at the friendship relations, we can identify a set of four people who are all mutual friends. In particular, Carol, Fran, George, and Heather form a clique (each one is friends with every other in that set). In any proper coloring (that is, assigning shirt‐colors with no two friends having the same color) the members of a clique must all have different colors.

Since we have exactly four colors available (red, green, blue, yellow), the members of the clique must use up all four colors. However, the friendship network tells us that Alice is friends with Carol, Fran, George, and Heather. That means that Alice cannot share any color with any of those four. But since those four already “use” all four colors, there is no color left available for Alice. 

Because at least one person (Alice) would be forced to have the same color as one of her friends, no valid assignment of colors exists.

We will show that no valid assignment is possible. One way to see this is to note that by looking at the friendship relations, we can identify a set of four people who are all mutual friends.

Since we have exactly four colors available (red, green, blue, yellow), the members of the clique must use up all four colors. However, the friendship network tells us that #0 is friends with #2, #5, #6, and #7. That means that #0 cannot share any color with any of those four. But since those four already “use” all four colors, there is no color left available for #0. 

Because at least one person (#0) would be forced to have the same color as one of her friends, no valid assignment of colors exists.
