We will show that no matter how you assign the four colors (red, green, blue, yellow) to the eight people, it is impossible to avoid giving two friends the same color.

Step 1. Note that Alice is friends with everyone else. Therefore, whoever color Alice wears (say red) cannot be used on Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, or Heather.

Step 2. That leaves only three colors (green, blue, and yellow) for the remaining seven people.

Step 3. However, if you look at the friendships among the remaining seven people, you will see many overlapping connections. For example, consider Bob, Carol, Ethan, Fran, and George. (In fact, one can verify there is a clique – a set of mutually connected people – of size 4 among these. For instance, Bob, Ethan, Fran, and George are all mutual friends.) A clique of size 4 in a graph means that four different colors are needed to color just those vertices. But we only have three colors available (since red was “used up” on Alice).

Step 4. Therefore, even before considering the rest of the connections, it is impossible to assign three colors to these seven people without a conflict. In other words, the graph (with vertices representing people and edges representing friendships) has chromatic number at least 5. Since we only have four colors, a proper coloring is impossible.

Thus, the answer is:

Impossible

We will show that no matter how you assign the four colors (red, green, blue, yellow) to the eight people, it is impossible to avoid giving two friends the same color.

Step 1. Note that #0 is friends with everyone else. Therefore, whoever color #0 wears (say red) cannot be used on #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, or #7.

Step 2. That leaves only three colors (green, blue, and yellow) for the remaining seven people.

Step 3. However, if you look at the friendships among the remaining seven people, you will see many overlapping connections. For example, consider #1, #2, #4, #5, and #6. (In fact, one can verify there is a clique – a set of mutually connected people – of size 4 among these. For instance, #1, #4, #5, and #6 are all mutual friends.) A clique of size 4 in a graph means that four different colors are needed to color just those vertices. But we only have three colors available (since red was “used up” on #0).
