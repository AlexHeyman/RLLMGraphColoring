We will show that under the given friendship (“adjacency”) relationships, the “conflict‐graph” contains a complete subgraph on 5 vertices. Since there are only 4 colors available but a complete graph on 5 vertices (a K₅) requires 5 different colors, it is impossible to assign each person one of the colors so that no two friends wear the same color shirt.

To explain a bit further:

1. Label the eight people as A (Alice), B (Bob), C (Carol), D (Dave), E (Ethan), F (Fran), G (George), and H (Heather).

2. The friendship relationships (which we treat as edges of a graph) are:
  • A is friends with B, C, D, G, H.
  • B is friends with A, C, E, F, G, H.
  • C is friends with A, B, D, F, G, H.
  • D is friends with A, C, E, F, G, H.
  • E is friends with B, D, F, G, H.
  • F is friends with B, C, D, E, G, H.
  • G is friends with A, B, C, D, E, F, H.
  • H is friends with A, B, C, D, E, F, G.

3. Notice that most pairs of vertices are adjacent; however, there are a few pairs that are not friends (for example, A is not friends with E or F; B and D are not friends; C and E are not friends; F and A are not friends). Even with these missing edges, one may verify that the vertices B, C, F, G, and H form a clique. In other words, every two among B, C, F, G, and H are friends:
  – G and H are friends with everyone.
  – B, C, and F are all mutually friends (as given by “B is friends with Carol and Fran”, “Carol is friends with Fran”, etc).

4. A clique of 5 people means that any valid coloring must assign 5 different colors to these vertices. Since only 4 colors (red, green, blue, yellow) are available, no assignment is possible that avoids a conflict among friends.

Thus, the answer is:

Impossible
