We will show that with the four given shirt‐colors there is no way to assign a color to each person so that any two friends wear different colors.

Let us describe the 8 people by the vertices

  A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H

corresponding to Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, and Heather. The list of friendships provides these edges:

• A (Alice) is friends with every other person.
• B (Bob) is friends with E (Ethan), F (Fran), G (George), and H (Heather).
• C (Carol) is friends with E, G, and H.
• D (Dave) is friends with E, F, G, and H.
• E (Ethan) is friends with B, C, D, G, and H.
• F (Fran) is friends with B, D, G, and H.
• G (George) is friends with A, B, C, D, E, F, and H.
• H (Heather) is friends with A, B, C, D, E, F, and G.

Notice that A is adjacent to all other vertices so whatever color A wears must be “unique” in the sense that none of the other seven may use that color. (There are four colors in all.) Thus, the remaining seven people are forced to use only the other three colors. However, if you examine the subgraph induced by {B, C, D, E, F, G, H} you will find a clique (a set of mutually adjacent vertices) of size 4. For instance, consider the set {B, E, G, H}. We have

  B is friends with E, G, and H.
  E is friends with B, G, and H.
  G is friends with B, E, and H.
  H is friends with B, E, and G.

This shows that {B, E, G, H} is a complete subgraph (K4). In any proper coloring of a graph a clique of size k requires at least k different colors. But we have forced these seven vertices to use only three colors (since A already uses one color and none of A’s friends may reuse that color). This is impossible.

Thus, there is no valid assignment of shirts (red, green, blue, yellow) to the 8 people that avoids a situation in which two friends wear the same color.
