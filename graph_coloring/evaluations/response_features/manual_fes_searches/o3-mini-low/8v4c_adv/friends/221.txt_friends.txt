We first list the people using letters for convenience:
• A (Alice)
• B (Bob)
• C (Carol)
• D (Dave)
• E (Ethan)
• F (Fran)
• G (George)
• H (Heather)

The given friendship relations are:

• A is friends with C, D, F, G, and H.
• B is friends with C, D, E, F, G, and H.
• C is friends with D, F, G, and H (in addition to A and B).
• D is friends with E, F, G, and H (in addition to A, B, and C).
• E is friends with F, G, and H (in addition to B and D).
• (F, G, and H get their friendships from the above statements.)

A key observation is to look for a clique—a set of people where every two are mutual friends. Note that:
• C is friends with D, F, G, and H.
• D is friends with C, F, G, and H.
• F is friends with A, B, C, D, and E (and, by symmetry, with G and H because each friendship was stated by someone).
• G and H share similar relations.
Thus, one finds that the set {D, F, G, H, E} all are pairwise friends:
 – D is friends with E, F, G, and H.
 – E is friends with F, G, and H.
 – F, G, and H are all connected with each other as dictated by the symmetry of the friendship declarations.
(In fact, one can also spot large interconnected groups that require at least 5 different colors.)

Since a clique of size 5 appears in the graph, any proper coloring of the vertices (where friends must have different colors) would require at least 5 colors. Since only 4 colors (red, green, blue, yellow) are available, it is impossible to assign shirts to the 8 people so that no pair of friends wears the same color shirt.
