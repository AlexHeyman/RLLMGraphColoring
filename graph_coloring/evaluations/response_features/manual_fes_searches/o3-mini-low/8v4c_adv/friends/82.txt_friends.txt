We start by noting that when each person wears one of the four colors (red, green, blue, yellow) and friends may not share a color, we are essentially trying to “4‐color” a graph whose vertices are the 8 people, with an edge between any two who are friends.

Listing the people and their friendships:
• Alice: Carol, Dave, Ethan, George, Heather
• Bob: Carol, Dave, Fran, George
• Carol: Alice, Bob, Dave, George, Heather
• Dave: Alice, Bob, Carol, Ethan, George, Heather
• Ethan: Alice, Dave, Fran, George, Heather
• Fran: Bob, Ethan, George, Heather
• George: Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, Heather
• Heather: Alice, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George

Notice in particular the relationships among Alice, Carol, Dave, and George:
– Alice is friends with Carol, Dave, George.
– Carol is friends with Alice, Dave, George.
– Dave is friends with Alice, Carol, George.
– George is friends with Alice, Carol, Dave.
Thus these four form a clique (a set of vertices every two of which are adjacent). In any proper coloring, each vertex in a clique must get a different color. So, Alice, Carol, Dave, and George must all be assigned different colors—using all four available colors.

Now consider Heather. Heather is friends with:
– Alice
– Carol
– Dave
– George
– Ethan
– Fran

Because Heather is friends with all four members of the clique {Alice, Carol, Dave, George}, she sees all four colors already (one on each friend). That leaves Heather no available color different from all of hers. Since there is no “fifth” color to choose from, a valid assignment is impossible.

Thus, the answer is:

Impossible

We start by noting that when each person wears one of the four colors (red, green, blue, yellow) and friends may not share a color, we are essentially trying to “4‐color” a graph whose vertices are the 8 people, with an edge between any two who are friends.

Listing the people and their friendships:
• #0: #2, #3, #4, #6, #7
• #1: #2, #3, #5, #6
• #2: #0, #1, #3, #6, #7
• #3: #0, #1, #2, #4, #6, #7
• #4: #0, #3, #5, #6, #7
• #5: #1, #4, #6, #7
• #6: #0, #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #7
• #7: #0, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6

Notice in particular the relationships among #0, #2, #3, and #6:
– #0 is friends with #2, #3, #6.
– #2 is friends with #0, #3, #6.
– #3 is friends with #0, #2, #6.
– #6 is friends with #0, #2, #3.
Thus these four form a clique (a set of vertices every two of which are adjacent). In any proper coloring, each vertex in a clique must get a different color. So, #0, #2, #3, and #6 must all be assigned different colors—using all four available colors.

Now consider #7. #7 is friends with:
– #0
– #2
– #3
– #6
– #4
– #5

Because #7 is friends with all four members of the clique {#0, #2, #3, #6}, she sees all four colors already (one on each friend). That leaves #7 no available color different from all of hers. Since there is no “fifth” color to choose from, a valid assignment is impossible.

Thus, the answer is:

Impossible
