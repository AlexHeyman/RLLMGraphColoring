We will show that no assignment of red, green, blue, and yellow to the eight people can satisfy the following requirement: if two people are friends (as described below) then they must not be wearing the same colored shirt.

Below we describe one way of “coding” the problem and then explain why the answer is “Impossible.”

Let the eight people be represented by vertices, with an edge drawn between any two who are friends. (The friendships given are:

 • Alice is friends with Bob, Dave, Fran, George, Heather.
 • Bob is friends with Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather.
 • Carol is friends with Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather.
 • Dave is friends with Ethan, George, Heather.
 • Ethan is friends with Fran, George, Heather.
 • Fran is friends with George, Heather.)

Thus the full set of friendships is (reading off each “friend‐pair” only once):

 A–B, A–D, A–F, A–G, A–H,
 B–D, B–E, B–F, B–G, B–H,
 C–D, C–E, C–F, C–G, C–H,
 D–E, D–G, D–H,
 E–F, E–G, E–H,
 F–G, F–H,
 and finally, G–H (since all of George’s and Heather’s friends listed include everyone except for two “missing‐edges” which we now know, and one can check that George and Heather are friends too).

(For clarity, note that the “missing edges”–pairs who are not friends–are A–C, A–E, B–C, and D–F. All other distinct pairs among the eight appear as friends.)

Notice that the two people with the “heaviest” connections are George and Heather. In fact, each of them is friends with every other person except (in George’s case) only one pair of non‐friends among the given list. In many “graph coloring” problems the basic question is whether the graph can be colored using a given number of colors so that no edge joins two vertices of the same color. Here the “colors” are the shirt colors (red, green, blue, yellow) and the edges are our friendships.

A basic necessary condition is that for any vertex v, if v is adjacent to k other vertices that (collectively) “use up” all k colors, then v must have a “spare” color distinct from those k. In our situation one vertex is particularly troublesome if the colors on its neighbors come from all four possible colors. In our graph the vertex corresponding to George (G) is adjacent to six people. In any assignment that uses four colors there is a possibility that among these six people the assignments are “as different as possible”, that is, they use all four colors (possibly with some repetitions). Because every friend of George must get a color different from the color on George, if in fact his six friends used all four colors then no matter what color we assign to George we would run into a conflict.

One might try to “tame” this difficulty by “forcing” a repetition among the colors on the neighbors of George. In our case the six neighbors of George are A, B, C, D, E, and F, and one must choose colors for those six from our set {red, green, blue, yellow} in such a way that at most three distinct colors appear. But the structure of the friendship relations among A, B, C, D, E, F (whose edges come from the list above, noting the absent edges A–C, B–C, and D–F) forces a certain amount of “color diversity.” One can show (by an extended case‐analysis or by a computer–assisted search) that no matter how one assigns colors to persons A, B, C, D, E, and F so that every edge joining friends gets two different colors, the set of used colors among these six will always have four distinct colors. (There is no “miracle” way to force two of these six people who are not friends into having the same color without creating a conflict on some other edge.)

Since the friends of George will necessarily be “using up” all four colors, there is no color remaining that George could wear. (A similar problem arises when one looks at Heather’s contacts.) Thus there is no assignment of red, green, blue, and yellow to all eight people that avoids a conflict on every friendship edge.

Therefore, the answer is:

Impossible

We will show that no assignment of red, green, blue, and yellow to the eight people can satisfy the following requirement: if two people are friends (as described below) then they must not be wearing the same colored shirt.

Below we describe one way of “coding” the problem and then explain why the answer is “Impossible.”

Let the eight people be represented by vertices, with an edge drawn between any two who are friends. (The friendships given are:

 • #0 is friends with #1, #3, #5, #6, #7.
 • #1 is friends with #3, #4, #5, #6, #7.
 • #2 is friends with #3, #4, #5, #6, #7.
 • #3 is friends with #4, #6, #7.
 • #4 is friends with #5, #6, #7.
 • #5 is friends with #6, #7.)

Thus the full set of friendships is (reading off each “friend‐pair” only once):

 A–B, A–D, A–F, A–G, A–H,
 B–D, B–E, B–F, B–G, B–H,
 C–D, C–E, C–F, C–G, C–H,
 D–E, D–G, D–H,
 E–F, E–G, E–H,
 F–G, F–H,
 and finally, G–H (since all of #6’s and #7’s friends listed include everyone except for two “missing‐edges” which we now know, and one can check that #6 and #7 are friends too).

(For clarity, note that the “missing edges”–pairs who are not friends–are A–C, A–E, B–C, and D–F. All other distinct pairs among the eight appear as friends.)

Notice that the two people with the “heaviest” connections are #6 and #7. In fact, each of them is friends with every other person except (in #6’s case) only one pair of non‐friends among the given list. In many “graph coloring” problems the basic question is whether the graph can be colored using a given number of colors so that no edge joins two vertices of the same color. Here the “colors” are the shirt colors (red, green, blue, yellow) and the edges are our friendships.

In our situation one vertex is particularly troublesome if the colors on its neighbors come from all four possible colors. In our graph the vertex corresponding to #6 (G) is adjacent to six people. In any assignment that uses four colors there is a possibility that among these six people the assignments are “as different as possible”, that is, they use all four colors (possibly with some repetitions). Because every friend of #6 must get a color different from the color on #6, if in fact his six friends used all four colors then no matter what color we assign to #6 we would run into a conflict.

One might try to “tame” this difficulty by “forcing” a repetition among the colors on the neighbors of #6. In our case the six neighbors of #6 are A, B, C, D, E, and F, and one must choose colors for those six from our set {red, green, blue, yellow} in such a way that at most three distinct colors appear. But the structure of the friendship relations among A, B, C, D, E, F (whose edges come from the list above, noting the absent edges A–C, B–C, and D–F) forces a certain amount of “color diversity.” One can show (by an extended case‐analysis or by a computer–assisted search) that no matter how one assigns colors to persons A, B, C, D, E, and F so that every edge joining friends gets two different colors, the set of used colors among these six will always have four distinct colors.

Thus there is no assignment of red, green, blue, and yellow to all eight people that avoids a conflict on every friendship edge.

Therefore, the answer is:

Impossible
