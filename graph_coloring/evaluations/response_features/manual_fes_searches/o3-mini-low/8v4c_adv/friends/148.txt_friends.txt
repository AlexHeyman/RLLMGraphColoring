Evaluation: impossible incorrect

We will show that no acceptable assignment is possible. In fact, if you look at the sub‐graph induced by Carol, Dave, Ethan, George, and Heather then every one of these five people is friends with each other. (For example, Carol is friends with Dave, Ethan, George, and Heather; Dave is friends with Ethan, George, and Heather; Ethan is friends with George and Heather; and George and Heather are friends.) This means that these five form a clique—a set of mutually adjacent vertices. In any proper coloring of a graph, each vertex in a clique must receive a different color. Since there are 5 people in this clique, we would need at least 5 different colors. However, only 4 colors (red, green, blue, and yellow) are available. 

Thus, it is impossible to assign the 4 colors so that no two friends wear the same color.
