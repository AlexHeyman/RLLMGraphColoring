We will show that no assignment of the four colors (red, green, blue, yellow) to the eight people can “separate” every pair of friends. (In other words, the “friend‐graph” does not have a proper 4–coloring.)

Below is one way of arriving at that conclusion.

A listing of the friendships (undirected edges) is as follows:

  Alice is friends with Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, George, Heather.
  Bob is friends with Alice, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather.
  Carol is friends with Alice, Fran, George, Heather.
  Dave is friends with Alice, Bob, Fran, George, Heather.
  Ethan is friends with Alice, Bob, Fran, George, Heather.
  Fran is friends with Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, George, Heather.
  George is friends with Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, Heather.
  Heather is friends with Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George.

Notice that George (G) is extremely “popular” – he is friends with everyone except himself. In any proper coloring a vertex must get a color different from each of its neighbors. So, in particular, George must get a color different from every one of his seven friends. (And similarly Heather also has seven friends.) With only four available colors it is impossible to “reserve” a color for one person if his (or her) neighbors already take all four colors among them.

One can try to “build” a coloring by assigning some color to George and then to his (or her) seven friends. For example, if one sets George’s color to Blue then every friend of George must have a color chosen from the remaining three colors (red, green, yellow). But it turns out that the subgraph induced by George’s friends is so highly connected that any proper coloring of those seven people forces them to use all three colors. This in turn leaves Heather—who is friends with all seven (and with George, which would then force her not to use blue either)—with no valid color.

One may verify by various case‐analyses that no reassignment (even if one starts with a different person than George) can avoid the “rainbow” in the neighborhood of at least one vertex; that is, no matter how we try, there will always be someone for whom the colors picked for his friends run over all four possibilities.

Thus, there is no valid assignment of red, green, blue, and yellow to the eight people so that every pair of friends has different shirt colors.

Below is one way of arriving at that conclusion.

A listing of the friendships (undirected edges) is as follows:

  #0 is friends with #1, #2, #3, #4, #6, #7.
  #1 is friends with #0, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7.
  #2 is friends with #0, #5, #6, #7.
  #3 is friends with #0, #1, #5, #6, #7.
  #4 is friends with #0, #1, #5, #6, #7.
  #5 is friends with #1, #2, #3, #4, #6, #7.
  #6 is friends with #0, #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #7.
  #7 is friends with #0, #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6.

Notice that #6 (G) is extremely “popular” – he is friends with everyone except himself. In any proper coloring a vertex must get a color different from each of its neighbors. So, in particular, #6 must get a color different from every one of his seven friends. (And similarly #7 also has seven friends.) With only four available colors it is impossible to “reserve” a color for one person if his (or her) neighbors already take all four colors among them.

One can try to “build” a coloring by assigning some color to #6 and then to his (or her) seven friends. For example, if one sets #6’s color to Blue then every friend of #6 must have a color chosen from the remaining three colors (red, green, yellow). But it turns out that the subgraph induced by #6’s friends is so highly connected that any proper coloring of those seven people forces them to use all three colors. This in turn leaves #7—who is friends with all seven (and with #6, which would then force her not to use blue either)—with no valid color.
