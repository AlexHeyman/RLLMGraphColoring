We will show that no matter how you try to assign the four shirt‐colors, at least one person is forced to be adjacent (i.e. friends) with people sporting all four colors. (In other words, a proper 4‑coloring of the “friendship graph” does not exist.)

Let’s explain briefly.

Label the eight people A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H corresponding to Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, and Heather. The friendship relations are given by the following edges:
 • A is friends with B, D, E, F, G, H.
 • B is friends with A, C, D, E, G, H.
 • C is friends with B and H.
 • D is friends with A, B, F, G, H.
 • E is friends with A, B, F, G, H.
 • F is friends with A, D, E, G, H.
 • G is friends with A, B, D, E, F, H.
 • H is friends with A, B, C, D, E, F, G.

Notice first that the set {A, B, D, H} forms a clique (each of these four are mutually friends among themselves). In any proper coloring (assignment of four colors), these four must all receive different colors.

Now, look at vertex G. Its friends are A, B, D, E, F, and H. Since A, B, D, and H already have four different colors, G is adjacent to people wearing all four colors. To avoid conflicts, G would need a “fifth” color. (Even if one tries to “re-use” a color among those neighbors, the clique forces A, B, D, and H to use all four colors and—after checking the additional restrictions coming from E and F—the six neighbors of G inevitably cover all four colors.)

A careful case–analysis (one example of which is given below) shows that no assignment of red, green, blue, and yellow to the eight individuals can satisfy the condition that no two friends share the same color.

Thus, it is impossible.

Impossible
