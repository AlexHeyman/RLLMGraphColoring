We will show that no assignment of four shirt‐colors (red, green, blue, yellow) to the eight people can “separate” all friends (that is, guarantee that every friendship links people wearing different colors).

Let us explain one way to see why a proper “coloring” (assignment) is impossible.

A “coloring” can be thought of as assigning one of the four colors to each person so that whenever two people are friends (that is, there is an “edge” joining their names), they have different colors. (In graph–theory language, we are asking whether the “friendship graph” described below has chromatic number ≤ 4.) The vertices are

 Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather.

The friendship relations are:
 • Alice is friends with Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather.
 • Bob is friends with Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather.
 • Carol is friends with Ethan, George, Heather.
 • Dave is friends with Ethan, Fran, George, Heather.
 • Ethan is friends with George, Heather.
 • Fran is friends with George, Heather.

(Also note that friendship is symmetric, so if Alice is friends with Dave then Dave is friends with Alice, etc.)

Now, one convenient way to “read” these relations is to notice that among these 8 people there is one person—George—who turns out to be “especially popular” (George is friends with everyone except possibly one or two of the others). In fact, in the list above George is mentioned as a friend in the relationships of Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, and Fran. In other words, George is connected to six of the other people. Furthermore, Heather is also mentioned as being friends with everyone except (for example) Bob is not said to be friends with Alice but he is friends with Heather; and a short check shows that Heather is friends with everyone except the very few missing from some lists). So one may show by “counting” inside the subgraph of the seven people who are all friends with Heather that no matter what assignment is made, those seven people end up “using” all four colors. (For example, one natural attempt would be to “pair up” some of the vertices to try to use only three colors among the friends of Heather so that Heather might use the missing color. However, a careful check shows that any valid coloring of the subgraph on the set {Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George} necessarily uses all four colors. In any such candidate coloring the “popular” vertex George ends up with neighbors wearing all four colors. That forces a conflict when one finally must assign Heather one of the four colors different from all those used by her neighbors.)

One may try many starting assignments – for example, one natural idea is to “merge” the colors of some non‐adjacent vertices (say, give Alice and Bob the same color, or have Ethan and Fran share a color since they are not declared to be friends). But then when one “checks” the set of friends of George (or Heather) it turns out that these six or seven people receive all four colors, and then no color remains available to assign to George (or Heather) that is different from every friend’s color.

A systematic attempt eventually leads to the conclusion that every 4–coloring of the graph fails (that is, somewhere two adjacent vertices must end up with the same color). In other words, the “friendship graph” in this problem has chromatic number 5 or more, so it is impossible to color it using only 4 colors.

Thus, no plan exists so that every pair of friends wears different colored shirts.

(In graph–theory language, we are asking whether the “friendship graph” described below has chromatic number ≤ 4.) The vertices are

 #0, #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7.

The friendship relations are:
 • #0 is friends with #3, #4, #5, #6, #7.
 • #1 is friends with #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7.
 • #2 is friends with #4, #6, #7.

 • #4 is friends with #6, #7.

(Also note that friendship is symmetric, so if #0 is friends with #3 then #3 is friends with #0, etc.)

Now, one convenient way to “read” these relations is to notice that among these 8 people there is one person—#6—who turns out to be “especially popular” (#6 is friends with everyone except possibly one or two of the others).
