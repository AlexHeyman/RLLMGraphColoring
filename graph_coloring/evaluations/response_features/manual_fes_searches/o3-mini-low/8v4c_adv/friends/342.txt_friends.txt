We will show that no assignment of the four shirt‐colors can be made so that no pair of friends wears the same color.

One way to see the problem is to view the people as vertices in a graph and a friendship as an edge connecting two vertices. Then each person must be “colored” (assigned a shirt‐color) in such a way that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. (The available colors are red, green, blue, and yellow.)

A careful look at the listed friendships reveals that some subsets of people form a clique (i.e. a set of vertices every two of which are adjacent). In particular, note that the set {Alice, Carol, Dave, George, Heather} is a clique. For instance:
 • Alice is friends with Carol, Dave, George, and Heather.
 • Carol is friends with Dave, George, and Heather.
 • Dave is friends with George and Heather.
 • George is friends with Heather.
Thus all five of these people are mutually “linked” by friendship. In any proper coloring, every vertex in a clique must have a different color. So this clique requires at least 5 distinct colors.

Because only four colors are available, it is impossible to assign a color to every person so that no pair of friends wears the same color.
