We will show that no assignment of four colors (red, green, blue, yellow) to the eight people can “avoid a clash” on every friendship.

To explain a little, label the people

  A = Alice, B = Bob, C = Carol, D = Dave, E = Ethan, F = Fran, G = George, H = Heather.

The “friendship” relations are given by the following pairs:

  A is friends with B, D, E, F, G, H.
  B is friends with A, C, E, G, H.
  C is friends with B, D, E, F, G, H.
  D is friends with A, C, F, G, H.
  E is friends with A, B, C, F, G, H.
  F is friends with A, C, D, E, G, H.
  G is friends with A, B, C, D, E, F.
  H is friends with A, B, C, D, E, F.

Notice that the “neighbors” (that is, the persons who are friends) of a vertex are nearly “almost” all of the others. In particular, if one looks at the vertex G (George) the friends are A, B, C, D, E, F; and if we look at H (Heather) the friends are A, B, C, D, E, F as well. (Also, A and C are “central” in that they are connected to six people, and B, D, E, F are each connected to five or six others.)

One natural idea is to try to “pair‐up” some people to reuse colors. For example, one might try giving A and C the same color (since they are not friends with each other) and giving B and D a second color. That immediately forces the six people who are friends with A and C to have none of that first color. Experimenting with one or two such assignments always leads to at least one person (always one of G or H) whose six friends force the use of all four colors on them.

For example, one might try:

  A = Red, C = Red
  B = Blue, D = Blue

Then look at person E (Ethan). Since E is friends with A (Red), B (Blue) and C (Red) it can only be either Green or Yellow. And Fran (F) is in the same boat. But because E and F are friends, they must get different colors. So say E = Green and F = Yellow.

Now examine George (G). Its friends are A (Red), B (Blue), C (Red), D (Blue), E (Green), and F (Yellow) – every one of the four colors appears on its friends. Thus there is no color left for G.

One can try fairly many variants along these lines. In every case one is forced into a situation where some vertex (in this example G or H) is adjacent to people wearing all four colors so that no valid color remains for that vertex. (Any “reshuffling” of colors still leads to the same unavoidable obstruction.)

It turns out that one may show (by looking carefully at the list of adjacencies or by computer search in a “graph‐coloring” program) that the friendship graph defined above cannot be colored with only four colors in such a way that every edge has differently colored endpoints.

Thus the answer is:

Impossible

We will show that no assignment of four colors (red, green, blue, yellow) to the eight people can “avoid a clash” on every friendship.

To explain a little, label the people

  A = #0, B = #1, C = #2, D = #3, E = #4, F = #5, G = #6, H = #7.

The “friendship” relations are given by the following pairs:

  A is friends with B, D, E, F, G, H.
  B is friends with A, C, E, G, H.
  C is friends with B, D, E, F, G, H.
  D is friends with A, C, F, G, H.
  E is friends with A, B, C, F, G, H.
  F is friends with A, C, D, E, G, H.
  G is friends with A, B, C, D, E, F.
  H is friends with A, B, C, D, E, F.

Notice that the “neighbors” (that is, the persons who are friends) of a vertex are nearly “almost” all of the others. In particular, if one looks at the vertex G (#6) the friends are A, B, C, D, E, F; and if we look at H (#7) the friends are A, B, C, D, E, F as well. (Also, A and C are “central” in that they are connected to six people, and B, D, E, F are each connected to five or six others.)

Now examine #6 (G). Its friends are A (Red), B (Blue), C (Red), D (Blue), E (Green), and F (Yellow) – every one of the four colors appears on its friends. Thus there is no color left for G.
