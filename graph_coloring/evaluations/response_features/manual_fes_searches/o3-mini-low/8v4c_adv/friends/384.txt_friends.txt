We will show that no proper assignment is possible. In other words, there is no way to assign each of the eight people one of the four colors {Red, Green, Blue, Yellow} so that every pair of friends ends up with different‐colored shirts.

To explain briefly (without giving away every attempt in our search):

• Label the people A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H corresponding to Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, and Heather.
• The friendship “graph” – where two people are adjacent when they are friends – has many “cross‐links.” For example, Alice is friends with six people; Bob, Carol, and several others have many friends within the group; and Heather (H) is friends with everyone except Carol in our list (and in fact H is adjacent to seven vertices). In any proper 4–coloring of a graph, every vertex’s neighbors must altogether use at most three colors (so that a fourth is available for that vertex). But because of the way these friendships have been arranged, one vertex—in this case Heather or another highly connected person—forces its neighbors to “use up” all four colors.
• In several attempts (one might start by trying to “fix” a color for Alice and then propagate the restrictions) one finds that one of the vertices eventually has all four colors forbidden by its adjacent friends.

Because every systematic assignment eventually runs into a conflict, we must conclude that with only four colors it is impossible to avoid a conflict between some pair of friends.

To explain briefly (without giving away every attempt in our search):

• Label the people A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H corresponding to #0, #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, and #7.
• The friendship “graph” – where two people are adjacent when they are friends – has many “cross‐links.” For example, #0 is friends with six people; #1, #2, and several others have many friends within the group; and #7 (H) is friends with everyone except #2 in our list (and in fact H is adjacent to seven vertices). In any proper 4–coloring of a graph, every vertex’s neighbors must altogether use at most three colors (so that a fourth is available for that vertex). But because of the way these friendships have been arranged, one vertex—in this case #7 or another highly connected person—forces its neighbors to “use up” all four colors.
