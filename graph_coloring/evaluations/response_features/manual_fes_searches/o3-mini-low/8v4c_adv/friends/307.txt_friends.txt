Let's first represent the situation as a graph. The vertices are the 8 people: A (Alice), B (Bob), C (Carol), D (Dave), E (Ethan), F (Fran), G (George), and H (Heather). An edge connects two people if they are friends. Based on the list:

• A is friends with B, C, D, E, G, H.
• B is friends with A, E, F, G, H.
• C is friends with A, E, F, G, H.
• D is friends with A, E, F, G, H.
• E is friends with A, B, C, D, F, G, H.
• F is friends with B, C, D, E, G, H.
• G is friends with A, B, C, D, E, F, H.
• H is friends with A, B, C, D, E, F, G.

Note in particular that:
– A is the only one not connected to F.
– B, C, and D are not pairwise joined (B is not friends with C nor D; C and D similarly). 
– All other friendships exist among the remaining vertices.

Because friendships are mutual our edges are undirected.

Now, the party rule is that if two people are friends (i.e. connected by an edge) they must not both wear the same shirt color. There are four available colors: red, green, blue, and yellow.

Observe a key point concerning vertex B. The neighbors of B are:
 A, E, G, H, and F isn’t adjacent to B? (Actually F is explicitly listed as a friend of B.)
So B’s neighbors are A, E, F, G, and H.
But look at vertices A, E, G, and H from the graph:
 • A is connected to E, G, and H (because A is friends with each of them).
 • E, G, and H form a triangle: E is friends with G and H, and G is friends with H.
Since a triangle requires three distinct colors when colored, and A is adjacent to all three, the subgraph induced by {A, E, G, H} forces all four colors to appear on these four vertices.

That is, whichever proper 4–coloring we assign, the four vertices A, E, G, and H will each have a distinct color. But then consider vertex B. Its set of friends includes A, E, G, and H. That gives B neighbors with all four colors. Therefore no matter what color we try to assign B, it would match one of its neighbors.

Because there is no way to avoid having B’s neighborhood include all four colors, it becomes impossible to assign a shirt color to everyone while obeying the rule.

Thus, the final answer is:

Impossible
