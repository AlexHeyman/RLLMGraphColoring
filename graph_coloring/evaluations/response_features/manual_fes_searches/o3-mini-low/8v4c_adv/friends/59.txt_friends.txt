We will show that no assignment of red, green, blue, and yellow shirts to the eight people, while having every person wear a different color from each of those they are directly friends with, can be found.

Below is an explanation.

Step 1. Write down the people and which friends they have:

 • Alice – friends with Bob, Ethan, George, Heather.
 • Bob – friends with Alice, Dave, Fran, George, Heather.
 • Carol – friends with Dave, George, Heather.
 • Dave – friends with Bob, Carol, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather.
 • Ethan – friends with Alice, Dave, Fran, George, Heather.
 • Fran – friends with Bob, Dave, Ethan, George, Heather.
 • George – friends with Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, Heather.
 • Heather – friends with Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George.

Step 2. Notice that one of the vertices (George) is connected with everyone except Carol. In addition, the five people {Bob, Dave, Fran, George, Heather} have many mutual friendship connections. In fact, one may check that every two of these five are friends (for example, Bob is friends with Dave, Fran, George, and Heather; Dave is friends with Bob, Fran, George, and Heather; and so on). This set of five vertices forms a complete subgraph—a clique of size 5.

A clique of size n forces the use of at least n different colors in any proper coloring of the graph (since every vertex must get a unique color relative to all its neighbors). In our case, having a clique of 5 means that one would require at least 5 colors. But we are only allowed 4 colors (red, green, blue, yellow).

Step 3. Because 4 colors are available but a clique of size 5 forces 5 different colors, there is no possible way to assign the 4 colors so that no friends share the same color.

Thus, the answer is:

Impossible

We will show that no assignment of red, green, blue, and yellow shirts to the eight people, while having every person wear a different color from each of those they are directly friends with, can be found.

Below is an explanation.

Step 1. Write down the people and which friends they have:

 • #0 – friends with #1, #4, #6, #7.
 • #1 – friends with #0, #3, #5, #6, #7.
 • #2 – friends with #3, #6, #7.
 • #3 – friends with #1, #2, #4, #5, #6, #7.
 • #4 – friends with #0, #3, #5, #6, #7.
 • #5 – friends with #1, #3, #4, #6, #7.
 • #6 – friends with #0, #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #7.
 • #7 – friends with #0, #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6.

Step 2. Notice that one of the vertices (#6) is connected with everyone except #2. In addition, the five people {#1, #3, #5, #6, #7} have many mutual friendship connections. In fact, one may check that every two of these five are friends (for example, #1 is friends with #3, #5, #6, and #7; #3 is friends with #1, #5, #6, and #7; and so on). This set of five vertices forms a complete subgraph—a clique of size 5.

A clique of size n forces the use of at least n different colors in any proper coloring of the graph (since every vertex must get a unique color relative to all its neighbors). In our case, having a clique of 5 means that one would require at least 5 colors. But we are only allowed 4 colors (red, green, blue, yellow).

Step 3. Because 4 colors are available but a clique of size 5 forces 5 different colors, there is no possible way to assign the 4 colors so that no friends share the same color.

Thus, the answer is:

Impossible
