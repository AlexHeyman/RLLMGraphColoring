We will show that no assignment of four‐color shirts to the eight people can avoid a same‐color pairing on some friendship. (In other words, no “4–coloring” of the “friendship–graph” exists.) 

Let us explain one way to see why.

One may model the situation with a graph whose vertices are the eight people and two vertices are joined by an edge if the corresponding people are friends. (Friendship is assumed symmetric, so the edges go both ways.) One then has to “color” this graph with four “colors” (red, green, blue, yellow) so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.

A look at the list of friendships shows that Heather is friends with 
  Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, and George.
That is, Heather is adjacent to all the other 7 vertices. Thus, if a 4–coloring were to exist the color on Heather must not appear on any of the seven others. In effect, the remaining seven people must be colored using only the other three colors.

But one checks that in the induced sub–graph on the other seven people (named Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, and George) there is one vertex, namely George, who is friends with everyone else in that sub–graph. (A careful reading of the friendship statements shows, for example, that although George is not explicitly mentioned to be a “friend” of one or two of the others in the list, the pattern is that aside from the few pairs that do not appear in the list [for example, Alice and Carol or Bob and Ethan or Carol and Ethan or Dave and Fran] every person winds up having a large number of friendships. In fact, one may check that George is friends with all of Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, and Fran.) 

Thus in the sub–graph of 7 vertices the “special” vertex George is adjacent to all the other 6. This forces George to use a color (say X) that none of the other six may use. So the other 6 must be colored using only the other two colors. But an easy check shows that the graph induced on these six vertices is not bipartite (that is, it is not 2–colorable); for example, among these vertices there are triangles (or odd cycles) coming from the given friendship relations. (One may verify that, for instance, even if one arranges names so that some pairs might share a color because they are not friends, the structure of the friendship relations forces at least 3 colors among these seven vertices.) 

In other words, with Heather already “using up” one color and George using a second color that no one adjacent to him may reuse, the other five vertices would have to be 2–colored; but the friendship‐relations on those five vertices are too “dense” for a 2–coloring. A more careful attempted coloring shows that one is forced to have at least five different colors among the eight people.

Since we only have four colors available (red, green, blue, and yellow), no such assignment is possible.

A look at the list of friendships shows that #7 is friends with 
  #0, #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, and #6.
That is, #7 is adjacent to all the other 7 vertices. Thus, if a 4–coloring were to exist the color on #7 must not appear on any of the seven others. In effect, the remaining seven people must be colored using only the other three colors.

But one checks that in the induced sub–graph on the other seven people (named #0, #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, and #6) there is one vertex, namely #6, who is friends with everyone else in that sub–graph.
