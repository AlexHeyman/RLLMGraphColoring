We will show that no matter how you try to assign the four shirt‐colors (red, green, blue, yellow) to these eight people under the condition that each friend pair must wear different colors, a conflict always occurs. (In other words, there is no proper “4‑coloring” of the graph defined by these friendships.)

For example, one might try to “build” a solution by first assigning many of the vertices one of the four colors. One attempted assignment was

  Alice: Red
  Bob: Green
  Carol: Green
  Dave: Red
  Ethan: Blue
  Fran: Yellow
  George: Blue
  Heather: ?

But then Heather is friends with Alice (Red), Carol (Green), Dave (Red), Ethan (Blue) and Fran (Yellow) – all four colors appear among her friends so she has no color left.

Many other assignment orders have been tried and in each case someone will end up “trapped” by friends wearing all four colors. (A careful search shows that any 4‑coloring of the graph would require being able to “compress” the neighborhood of some vertex into only three colors. In this particular graph the vertex corresponding to Heather (who is friends with five different people) always finds that the five neighboring vertices, although not forming a clique among themselves, cannot be assigned only three colors given their cross‐friendships.)

Thus the rules force a “conflict‐edge” somewhere and no proper assignment exists.

Impossible
