The answer is impossible.

To explain briefly, if you look at the friendships of Alice, Bob, Carol, George, and Heather, you notice that each of these five is friends with each of the others. (For example, Alice is friends with Bob, Carol, George, and Heather; Bob is friends with Alice, Carol, George, and Heather; and so on.) That means these five people form a clique of 5. In any clique, every person must have a different shirt color. Since we only have 4 colors available, it isn’t possible to assign shirts so that no two friends share the same color.

Impossible
