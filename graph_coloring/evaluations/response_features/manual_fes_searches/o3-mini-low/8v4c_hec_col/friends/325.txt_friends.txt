We will show that any assignment of four colors (red, green, blue, yellow) to the eight people so that friends never share a color is impossible.

To explain briefly, note that by the given friendship list the following four people form a clique (a set of vertices each of which is adjacent to every other in the group): Bob, Carol, Dave, and Heather. Thus, in any valid shirt–coloring these four must all wear different colors. For example, one might try to set

  Bob: Red
  Carol: Green
  Dave: Blue
  Heather: Yellow

Now consider Ethan. According to the friendships, Ethan is friends with Bob, Carol, Dave, and Heather—so, he is adjacent to all four colors. This means that nothing is left for Ethan. (One might wonder if a different assignment could avoid this, but any valid coloring must give four different colors to the clique, and Ethan is friends with all four members of it.) 

Because at least one person (Ethan) would have no valid color left, it is impossible to assign a shirt color to everyone as required.

We will show that any assignment of four colors (red, green, blue, yellow) to the eight people so that friends never share a color is impossible.

To explain briefly, note that by the given friendship list the following four people form a clique (a set of vertices each of which is adjacent to every other in the group): #1, #2, #3, and #7. Thus, in any valid shirt–coloring these four must all wear different colors. For example, one might try to set

  #1: Red
  #2: Green
  #3: Blue
  #7: Yellow

Now consider #4. According to the friendships, #4 is friends with #1, #2, #3, and #7—so, he is adjacent to all four colors. This means that nothing is left for #4. (One might wonder if a different assignment could avoid this, but any valid coloring must give four different colors to the clique, and #4 is friends with all four members of it.) 

Because at least one person (#4) would have no valid color left, it is impossible to assign a shirt color to everyone as required.
