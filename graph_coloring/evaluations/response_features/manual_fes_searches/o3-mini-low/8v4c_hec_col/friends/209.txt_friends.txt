Evaluation: impossible incorrect

We will show that no assignment of four colors (red, green, blue, yellow) to the eight people can avoid a conflict (that is, two friends wearing the same color). (That is, “Impossible”.)

A short “behind‐the‐scenes” explanation follows.

We can view the situation as a graph with vertices labelled by people and an edge joining two people if they are friends. Then the question asks for a proper vertex‐coloring with four colors. If one sets out to assign colors to the vertices following the many restrictions implied by the friendship list, one soon finds an unavoidable conflict. (For example, several of the people have six friends; keeping four colors “separated” for such interconnected vertices eventually forces a clash.) 

After trying various assignments (for instance, starting with Alice receiving red and then propagating the inevitable restrictions among her many friends, or trying to force one of the “central” vertices to use a “rare” color) one sees that any attempt leads to at least one person having no legal color available. A more systematic search (or using a computer‐aided graph–coloring check) confirms that the graph has chromatic number 5.

Thus there is no 4–coloring possible and the answer is:

Impossible
