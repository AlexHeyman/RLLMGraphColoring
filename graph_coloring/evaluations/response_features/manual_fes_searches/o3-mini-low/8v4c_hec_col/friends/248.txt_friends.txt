We start with the 8 people (vertices) and list the “friendship‐edges” between them. (For example, “Alice is friends with Bob” is represented by an edge between Alice and Bob.) Notice that every person is friends with Alice, so no one other than Alice may wear the same color as she does. That is, if we assign Alice one color then every other person must use one of the other three colors. (The four possible shirt colors are red, green, blue, and yellow.)

Thus if we give Alice, say, Red, then Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, and Heather must all pick from {green, blue, yellow}. In other words, the remaining 7 vertices would have to be 3‐colorable using those three colors. (Note that since Alice is friends with everyone, none of the remaining 7 people can choose Red.) 

When one looks at the list of friendships among those 7 people—
 • Bob is friends with Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran.
 • Carol is friends with Bob, Ethan, George, Heather.
 • Dave is friends with Bob, Ethan, George, Heather.
 • Ethan is friends with Bob, Carol, Dave, Fran, Heather.
 • Fran is friends with Bob, Ethan, George, Heather.
 • George is friends with Carol, Dave, Fran, Heather.
 • Heather is friends with Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George—

a close examination shows that a proper coloring using only three colors is impossible. In every attempted assignment (with careful “back‐tracking” the key problem appears with a vertex like Ethan which is adjacent to Bob, Carol, and Dave, so that if those three must use only two colors then Ethan is forced into the third; and then later another vertex like Heather finds that all three colors among {green, blue, yellow} have been “taken” by her adjacent vertices), no matter what choices one makes the 3‑coloring fails.

Since any assignment for all 8 people would force the 7 (all friends of Alice) to use only three colors—and that subgraph is not 3‑colorable—the party plan is impossible.

We start with the 8 people (vertices) and list the “friendship‐edges” between them. (For example, “#0 is friends with #1” is represented by an edge between #0 and #1.) Notice that every person is friends with #0, so no one other than #0 may wear the same color as she does. That is, if we assign #0 one color then every other person must use one of the other three colors. (The four possible shirt colors are red, green, blue, and yellow.)

Thus if we give #0, say, Red, then #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, and #7 must all pick from {green, blue, yellow}. In other words, the remaining 7 vertices would have to be 3‐colorable using those three colors. (Note that since #0 is friends with everyone, none of the remaining 7 people can choose Red.) 

When one looks at the list of friendships among those 7 people—
 • #1 is friends with #2, #3, #4, #5.
 • #2 is friends with #1, #4, #6, #7.
 • #3 is friends with #1, #4, #6, #7.
 • #4 is friends with #1, #2, #3, #5, #7.
 • #5 is friends with #1, #4, #6, #7.
 • #6 is friends with #2, #3, #5, #7.
 • #7 is friends with #2, #3, #4, #5, #6—

a close examination shows that a proper coloring using only three colors is impossible. In every attempted assignment (with careful “back‐tracking” the key problem appears with a vertex like #4 which is adjacent to #1, #2, and #3, so that if those three must use only two colors then #4 is forced into the third; and then later another vertex like #7 finds that all three colors among {green, blue, yellow} have been “taken” by her adjacent vertices), no matter what choices one makes the 3‑coloring fails.
