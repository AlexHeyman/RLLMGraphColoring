We will show that no matter how you try to assign four colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow) to these eight people – with the rule that no two people who are friends share the same color – there is no solution.

A short explanation follows.

Label the people as follows:
• A = Alice  
• B = Bob  
• C = Carol  
• D = Dave  
• E = Ethan  
• F = Fran  
• G = George  
• H = Heather  

The friendship relationships are such that:
• Alice is friends with B, C, D, E, G, H.
• Bob is friends with A, D, E, F, G, H.
• Carol is friends with A, D, E, G, H.
• Dave is friends with A, B, C, G, H.
• Ethan is friends with A, B, C, G, H.
• Fran is friends with B, G, H.
• George is friends with A, B, C, D, E, F, H.
• Heather is friends with A, B, C, D, E, F, G.

Now, notice in particular the situation for Dave and Ethan. For instance, Dave is adjacent to A, B, C, G, and H. Careful inspection of the friendships shows that among these five people, the only pair that may share a color (if they are not friends) is Bob and Carol. In every proper coloring of the “sub‐graph” induced by {A, B, C, G, H}, one may try to force a duplication only at B and C. However, the edges are such that
 – Alice is friends with all of B, C, G, and H;  
 – George and Heather are each friends with A, B, and C, and with each other.

Thus even if we let Bob and Carol share the same color, the five neighbors of Dave will use four distinct colors (one on A, one shared on B and C counts as one color, one on G, and one on H). Since we have only four colors available in total, Dave – being adjacent to all four of these colors – would have no color left to assign. The same issue occurs for Ethan.

Because of these problems in any attempted assignment, it follows that there is no way to pick colors for all eight people meeting the friendship restrictions.

We will show that no matter how you try to assign four colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow) to these eight people – with the rule that no two people who are friends share the same color – there is no solution.

A short explanation follows.

Label the people as follows:
• A = #0  
• B = #1  
• C = #2  
• D = #3  
• E = #4  
• F = #5  
• G = #6  
• H = #7  

The friendship relationships are such that:
• #0 is friends with B, C, D, E, G, H.
• #1 is friends with A, D, E, F, G, H.
• #2 is friends with A, D, E, G, H.
• #3 is friends with A, B, C, G, H.
• #4 is friends with A, B, C, G, H.
• #5 is friends with B, G, H.
• #6 is friends with A, B, C, D, E, F, H.
• #7 is friends with A, B, C, D, E, F, G.

Now, notice in particular the situation for #3 and #4. For instance, #3 is adjacent to A, B, C, G, and H. Careful inspection of the friendships shows that among these five people, the only pair that may share a color (if they are not friends) is #1 and #2. In every proper coloring of the “sub‐graph” induced by {A, B, C, G, H}, one may try to force a duplication only at B and C. However, the edges are such that
 – #0 is friends with all of B, C, G, and H;  
 – #6 and #7 are each friends with A, B, and C, and with each other.

Thus even if we let #1 and #2 share the same color, the five neighbors of #3 will use four distinct colors (one on A, one shared on B and C counts as one color, one on G, and one on H). Since we have only four colors available in total, #3 – being adjacent to all four of these colors – would have no color left to assign. The same issue occurs for #4.

Because of these problems in any attempted assignment, it follows that there is no way to pick colors for all eight people meeting the friendship restrictions.
