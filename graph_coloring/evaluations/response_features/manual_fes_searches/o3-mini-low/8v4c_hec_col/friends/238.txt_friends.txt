We will show that it is not possible to “color” (i.e. assign t-shirt colors to) the eight people from only four available colors while making sure that any two people who are friends wear different colors.

Let us explain briefly how one may arrive at that fact.

One way to view the problem is to model the eight people as vertices of a graph, with an edge connecting any two people who are friends. (For example, Alice is connected to Bob, Carol, Ethan, George, and Heather; Bob to Alice, Carol, Fran, George, and Heather; and so forth.) Then the requested assignment of t-shirt colors corresponds exactly to a “graph coloring” in which adjacent vertices receive different colors, and the colors available are red, green, blue, and yellow.

A careful reading of the friendship list reveals that there is a “dense” part of the graph. In fact, two of the people – George and Heather – are quite “popular.” For example, Heather is friends with everyone except herself and George. In any valid coloring the two (George and Heather) must receive different colors. Now, every other vertex (person) is adjacent to both George and Heather, and so none of these six people can use the two colors already used on George and Heather. That leaves only two colors available for the remaining six vertices.

However, if you look at those six vertices (Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran) and check the friendship relations among them you will find cycles of odd length (in particular, a triangle: for instance, Alice, Bob, and Carol are mutually connected). In a graph if you have to color it using only two colors then the graph must be bipartite (that is, it must have no odd cycles). Since here a triangle (an odd cycle of length 3) is present, it is impossible to color that part with only two colors.

Because of this unavoidable “2‐color restriction” for six of the vertices (forced by the choices for George and Heather), there is no valid 4–coloring of the entire graph.

Thus, under the problem’s conditions it is impossible to assign the four t-shirt colors so that no pair of friends wears the same color.
