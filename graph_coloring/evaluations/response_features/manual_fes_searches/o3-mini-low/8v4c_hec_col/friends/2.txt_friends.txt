We first list the friendships as given:

• Alice: Bob, Ethan, Fran, George  
• Bob: Alice, Carol, Ethan, Fran, George  
• Carol: Bob, Dave, Fran, George  
• Dave: Carol, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather  
• Ethan: Alice, Bob, Dave, Fran, George, Heather  
• Fran: Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Heather  
• George: Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Heather  
• Heather: Dave, Ethan, Fran, George  

Notice that if we look at the set {Alice, Bob, Ethan, Fran, George} the friendships include:
 – Alice is friends with Bob, Ethan, Fran, and George  
 – Bob is friends with Alice, Ethan, Fran, and George  
 – Ethan is friends with Alice, Bob, Fran, and George  
 – Fran is friends with Alice, Bob, Ethan, and George  
 – George is friends with Alice, Bob, Ethan, and Fran  

This means that these five people form a complete graph (K₅), where every pair is friends.

In a complete graph of five vertices (K₅), every person must wear a different color from every other. Therefore, at least 5 distinct colors are needed. Since only 4 shirts colors (red, green, blue, yellow) are available, it is impossible to assign a shirt color to each person in such a way that no two friends share the same color.
