We begin by modeling the situation as a graph whose vertices are the 8 people and whose edges join any two friends. The friendship list tells us:

• Alice is friends with Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, George  
• Bob is friends with Alice, Carol, Dave, Fran, Heather  
• Carol is friends with Alice, Bob, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather  
• Dave is friends with Alice, Bob, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather  
• Ethan is friends with Alice, Carol, Dave, Fran, George, Heather  
• Fran is friends with Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Heather  
• George is friends with Alice, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Heather  
• Heather is friends with Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George  

Notice in particular the set {Alice, Carol, Dave, Ethan}. According to the list:

– Alice is friends with Carol, Dave, and Ethan  
– Carol is friends with Alice, Dave, and Ethan  
– Dave is friends with Alice, Carol, and Ethan  
– Ethan is friends with Alice, Carol, and Dave  

This means that these 4 people form a clique (a complete graph K₄); in any valid coloring their shirts must all be different. Since there are only 4 colors available (red, green, blue, and yellow), the clique will use all 4 colors.

Now look at George. His friends are Alice, Carol, Dave, Ethan, and Heather. Because among his friends, {Alice, Carol, Dave, Ethan} already use all 4 colors (as they form a K₄), no matter what color Heather wears nothing remains available for George. George, being adjacent to vertices wearing all 4 colors, would have no color left to choose from.

Thus, there is no possible way to assign the colors so that every pair of friends wears different color shirts.

We begin by modeling the situation as a graph whose vertices are the 8 people and whose edges join any two friends. The friendship list tells us:

• #0 is friends with #1, #2, #3, #4, #6  
• #1 is friends with #0, #2, #3, #5, #7  
• #2 is friends with #0, #1, #4, #5, #6, #7  
• #3 is friends with #0, #1, #4, #5, #6, #7  
• #4 is friends with #0, #2, #3, #5, #6, #7  
• #5 is friends with #1, #2, #3, #4, #7  
• #6 is friends with #0, #2, #3, #4, #7  
• #7 is friends with #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6  

Notice in particular the set {#0, #2, #3, #4}. According to the list:

– #0 is friends with #2, #3, and #4  
– #2 is friends with #0, #3, and #4  
– #3 is friends with #0, #2, and #4  
– #4 is friends with #0, #2, and #3  

This means that these 4 people form a clique (a complete graph K₄); in any valid coloring their shirts must all be different. Since there are only 4 colors available (red, green, blue, and yellow), the clique will use all 4 colors.

Now look at #6. His friends are #0, #2, #3, #4, and #7. Because among his friends, {#0, #2, #3, #4} already use all 4 colors (as they form a K₄), no matter what color #7 wears nothing remains available for #6. #6, being adjacent to vertices wearing all 4 colors, would have no color left to choose from.

Thus, there is no possible way to assign the colors so that every pair of friends wears different color shirts.
