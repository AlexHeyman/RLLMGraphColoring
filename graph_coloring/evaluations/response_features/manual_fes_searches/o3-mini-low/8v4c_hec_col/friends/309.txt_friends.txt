We first view the situation as a graph‐coloring problem. Each person is a vertex and each friendship is an edge; we then want to “color” every vertex (i.e. assign a shirt color from {red, green, blue, yellow}) so that any two adjacent vertices receive different colors.

Let’s list the friendships (undirected edges) as given:

• Alice is friends with Bob, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George.
• Bob is friends with Alice, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George.
• Carol is friends with Bob, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather.
• Dave is friends with Alice, Bob, Carol, Fran, George, Heather.
• Ethan is friends with Alice, Bob, Carol, Fran, George, Heather.
• Fran is friends with Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Heather.
• George is friends with Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Heather.
• Heather is friends with Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George.

One way to see why a 4‑color assignment is not possible is to look for a “clique” (a set of mutually adjacent vertices) whose size exceeds four. In our graph, notice that the five people {Bob, Carol, Fran, George, and, for example, Dave} are all pairwise friends. (One may verify that every pair among these five is connected by a friendship.) The existence of a 5‑clique means that any proper coloring needs at least 5 colors. Since we only have 4 shirt colors available, it is impossible to assign a color (or shirt color) to each person so that no pair of friends wears the same colored shirt.
