We will show by “trying” to assign shirt‐colors (and “backtracking”) that any assignment using only red, green, blue, and yellow must fail. (In other words, the “friendship–graph” on these 8 people has chromatic number 5.) 

To explain briefly, label the people as follows:
 A = Alice, B = Bob, C = Carol, D = Dave, E = Ethan, F = Fran, G = George, H = Heather.
The friendships give the following edges:
 A is connected to B, C, D, E, F, H.
 B is connected to A, D, E, F, G, H.
 C is connected to A, D, E, F, G, H.
 D is connected to A, B, C, F, G, H.
 E is connected to A, B, C, F, G, H.
 F is connected to A, B, C, D, E, G.
 G is connected to B, C, D, E, F.
 H is connected to A, B, C, D, E.

Because A, B, and C are pairwise “friends” (so they must wear different colors) they use three different colors. But then look at D and E. Each is friends with A, B, and C so every one of them must use the “fourth” remaining color. (For example, if A, B, C get red, green, and blue then D and E must both be yellow.) But then F, who is friends with A, B, C, D, and E, sees that all four colors have already been “taken” among his friends, leaving F with no legal choice. (One need not even worry about G or H; the conflict at F forces failure.)

Since even one vertex (Fran) ends up “blocked” from all four colors, there is no valid assignment of the four shirt colors meeting the friendship condition.

Thus the final answer is:

Impossible

To explain briefly, label the people as follows:
 A = #0, B = #1, C = #2, D = #3, E = #4, F = #5, G = #6, H = #7.
The friendships give the following edges:
 A is connected to B, C, D, E, F, H.
 B is connected to A, D, E, F, G, H.
 C is connected to A, D, E, F, G, H.
 D is connected to A, B, C, F, G, H.

 F is connected to A, B, C, D, E, G.
