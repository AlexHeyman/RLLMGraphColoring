We first note that a proper assignment of 4 colors to the 8 people (with the condition that friends must wear different colors) is only possible if the “friendship‐graph” can be colored with 4 colors. One way to show that 4 colors are insufficient is to find a clique (a set of people who are all pairwise friends) of size 5. (Every member of a clique must receive a different color.)

Examine the following five people:
 • Alice
 • Carol
 • Dave
 • Ethan
 • Fran

Looking at the friendship list we have:
 – Alice is friends with Carol, Dave, Ethan, and Fran.
 – Carol is friends with Alice, Dave, Ethan, and Fran.
 – Dave is friends with Alice, Carol, and Fran, and Dave is also friends with Ethan.
 – Ethan is friends with Alice, Carol, and Fran, and with Dave as well.
 – Fran is friends with Alice, Carol, Dave, and Ethan.

Thus every pair among {Alice, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran} are friends. This forms a clique of 5 people. In any proper coloring, each of these 5 must have a different color. Since we only have 4 colors available, it is impossible to assign colors satisfying the condition.

One way to show that 4 colors are insufficient is to find a clique (a set of people who are all pairwise friends) of size 5. (Every member of a clique must receive a different color.)

Examine the following five people:
 • #0
 • #2
 • #3
 • #4
 • #5

Looking at the friendship list we have:
 – #0 is friends with #2, #3, #4, and #5.
 – #2 is friends with #0, #3, #4, and #5.
 – #3 is friends with #0, #2, and #5, and #3 is also friends with #4.
 – #4 is friends with #0, #2, and #5, and with #3 as well.
 – #5 is friends with #0, #2, #3, and #4.

Thus every pair among {#0, #2, #3, #4, #5} are friends. This forms a clique of 5 people. In any proper coloring, each of these 5 must have a different color. Since we only have 4 colors available, it is impossible to assign colors satisfying the condition.
