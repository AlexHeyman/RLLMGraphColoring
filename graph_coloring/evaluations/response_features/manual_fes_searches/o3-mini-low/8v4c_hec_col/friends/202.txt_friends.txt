We will show that no assignment of red, green, blue, and yellow shirts to

  Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather

can be made so that whenever two of these people are friends they have different shirt‐colors.

One way to “prove” this is to show that no matter how you begin assigning colors it forces two people who are friends to end up with the same color. (Any attempted coloring with four colors runs into a “bottleneck” in the graph of friendships.)

To explain briefly one of the ways one may try to assign colors, note that Alice is friends with everyone else. So if we give Alice any color (say Red), then everyone else must use one of {Green, Blue, Yellow}.

Now, consider the four people Dave, Ethan, Fran, and George. A careful look at the list shows that Dave and Ethan share exactly the same friends among {Alice, Bob, Carol, Fran, George, Heather} and are themselves friends. In any coloring the colors forbidden to Dave and Ethan (that is, the collection of shirt–colors picked by all of their neighbors) come from the assignments on six vertices. In order that Dave and Ethan (neighbors) have two different available colors for themselves it is necessary that the six “neighbor” assignments use at most two differentcolors. (In other words, if the neighbors together use three or four different colors, then only one color remains for Dave and Ethan, forcing a clash.) But when one checks the friendships among the six (which include Bob, Carol, Fran, and Heather – some of whom are mutually friends) one sees that it is impossible to “squeeze” all their assignments into only two colors.

Many attempts at assigning colors step into the same conflict. (One may even try a systematic back‐tracking argument to show that every complete assignment leads to a violation of the “friends must have different colors” rule.)

Thus no valid assignment exists.
