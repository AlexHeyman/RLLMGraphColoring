We will show that no matter how one tries to assign colors (red, green, blue, yellow) to these 8 people subject to the rule that friends must have different shirt‐colors, no valid assignment exists.

Let’s explain briefly one way to see the difficulty.

Step 1. Notice that Alice is friends with everyone else so if we give Alice any color (say Red) then none of the other 7 people may wear red. In other words, the remaining 7 people must be colored using the other three colors: green, blue, and yellow.

Step 2. Now consider the subgraph induced by the remaining people: Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, and Heather. Their friendships (aside from those with Alice) include:
 • Bob is friends with Ethan, George, and Heather.
 • Carol is friends with Dave, George, and Heather.
 • Dave is friends with Carol, Ethan, George, and Heather.
 • Ethan is friends with Bob, Dave, Fran, George, and Heather.
 • Fran is friends with Ethan, George, and Heather.
 • George is friends with Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, and Heather.
 • Heather is friends with Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, and George.

A quick inspection reveals that, for example, the set {Ethan, Fran, George, Heather} forms a clique (each is friends with every other member of that set). (To check: Ethan is friends with Fran, George, and Heather; Fran is friends with Ethan, George, and Heather; and George and Heather are friends with everyone in the group.) A clique of size 4 requires 4 different colors. But the remaining 7 people are forced to use only 3 colors (green, blue, yellow) because none can use red (Alice’s color).

Step 3. Because this clique already forces a requirement of 4 different colors, there is no way to assign clothes colors to all 8 people following the rule.

Thus, such an assignment is impossible.

Impossible

Let’s explain briefly one way to see the difficulty.

Step 1. Notice that #0 is friends with everyone else so if we give #0 any color (say Red) then none of the other 7 people may wear red. In other words, the remaining 7 people must be colored using the other three colors: green, blue, and yellow.

Step 2. Now consider the subgraph induced by the remaining people: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, and #7. Their friendships (aside from those with #0) include:
 • #1 is friends with #4, #6, and #7.
 • #2 is friends with #3, #6, and #7.
 • #3 is friends with #2, #4, #6, and #7.
 • #4 is friends with #1, #3, #5, #6, and #7.
 • #5 is friends with #4, #6, and #7.
 • #6 is friends with #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, and #7.
 • #7 is friends with #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, and #6.

A quick inspection reveals that, for example, the set {#4, #5, #6, #7} forms a clique (each is friends with every other member of that set). (To check: #4 is friends with #5, #6, and #7; #5 is friends with #4, #6, and #7; and #6 and #7 are friends with everyone in the group.) A clique of size 4 requires 4 different colors. But the remaining 7 people are forced to use only 3 colors (green, blue, yellow) because none can use red (#0’s color).

Step 3. Because this clique already forces a requirement of 4 different colors, there is no way to assign clothes colors to all 8 people following the rule.

Thus, such an assignment is impossible.
