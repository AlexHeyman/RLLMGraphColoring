I'll explain my reasoning. One might try to assign colors step‐by‐step to the 8 vertices (labeled 0 through 7) using the allowed colors {Red, Green, Blue, Yellow} while ensuring that no edge connects two vertices of the same color. However, no matter how one “starts,” one eventually reaches a vertex (in these trials vertex 6 appears repeatedly) that is adjacent to vertices using all four colors. For example, if one sets

  vertex 0 = Red,
  vertex 1 = Green,
  vertex 2 = Blue,
  vertex 3 = (any choice, say Yellow), 
  vertex 4, vertex 5 … 

one is forced eventually to assign colors to vertex 6. But vertex 6 is adjacent to vertices 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 – and in every attempted assignment those neighbors end up “collectively” using all four colors. That means that no color remains available for vertex 6.

I attempted several different assignments (for instance, by changing the color of vertex 3 or vertex 2) and in every case one runs into the same unavoidable problem. Thus, there is no proper 4–coloring of the given graph.
