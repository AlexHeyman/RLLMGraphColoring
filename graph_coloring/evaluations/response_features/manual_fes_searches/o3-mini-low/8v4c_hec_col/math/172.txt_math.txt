We will show that, given the edge set, there is a complete subgraph (a clique) on 5 vertices. In any proper vertex‐coloring of a graph, every vertex in a clique must receive a different color. Thus, the existence of a clique on 5 vertices in a graph means that at least 5 colors are needed.

Observe that vertices 0, 1, 2, 3, and 7 share the following edges:
 (0,1), (0,3), (0,7)
 (1,2), (1,3), (1,7)
 (2,3), (2,7)
 (3,7)

These edges show that every pair among {0, 1, 2, 3, 7} is connected by an edge. Hence, the subgraph induced by {0, 1, 2, 3, 7} is a complete graph K₅.

Since we are limited to 4 colors (red, green, blue, yellow), a proper coloring (where adjacent vertices have different colors) is impossible.

Impossible
