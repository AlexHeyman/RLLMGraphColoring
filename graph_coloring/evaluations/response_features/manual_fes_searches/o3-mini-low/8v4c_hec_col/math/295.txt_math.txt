We will show that no assignment of the four colors (red, green, blue, yellow) to the eight vertices can avoid having two adjacent vertices share the same color.

To explain briefly (one may try many “back‐tracking” color–assignment approaches):

• Label the vertices 0,…,7 and note the “neighbor lists” (that is, the vertices adjacent by an edge). For example, vertex 2 is adjacent to 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Other vertices (like vertex 5 for instance) have many neighbors as well. (You may verify each edge in the given list.)

• Because vertex 2 touches seven other vertices, its color “affects” almost everything else. No matter what color is chosen for vertex 2 (say “Red”) the seven neighbors of 2 are forced to avoid Red.

• Then one may try to choose colors for one of those high–degree neighbors (for instance vertex 7) and then continue picking a vertex that “sees” many already–colored vertices. In every branch one ultimately finds a vertex that – because of the adjacent colors already used by its neighbors – has no possibility left from the four colors.

One may try several different orders or “branches” (for example, beginning by assigning vertex 2 and then vertex 7, or beginning in a different order). In every systematic exploration the process runs into a conflict: a vertex is left with all four colors already “blocked” by its adjacent vertices. (For example, in one branch one finds that after assigning vertex 2 = Red, vertex 7 = Green, and then assigning colors to some of the neighbors, a vertex’s neighbor set ends up using Red, Green, Blue and Yellow – leaving no option.)

Thus, after a careful case–analysis (or by using a computer–assisted search) one must conclude that there is no valid 4–coloring of the graph.
