Let's analyze the situation. Vertex 0 is connected to every other vertex. This means that all other vertices (vertices 1 through 7) must get a color different from vertex 0. Now, if we try an approach where we assign a color to vertex 0 and then assign distinct colors among the remaining vertices, we soon run into trouble.

For example, suppose we set:
 0 Red

Then all of vertices 1,…,7 must be non‑Red. Suppose we try:
 1 Green
 2 Blue
 3 Yellow

Now consider vertex 4. Its neighbors include vertex 0 (Red), vertex 1 (Green), vertex 2 (Blue), and vertex 3 (Yellow) (since (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), and (3,4) are edges). That leaves no available color from {Red, Green, Blue, Yellow} for vertex 4. 

Since vertex 4 is forced to be different from all four colors, a valid 4‑coloring is impossible. 

Thus, the final answer is:
Impossible
