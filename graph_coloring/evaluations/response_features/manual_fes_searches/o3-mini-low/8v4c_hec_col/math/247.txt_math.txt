We will show that no proper 4‐coloring exists for the given graph. In other words, it is impossible to assign each vertex one of the colors {Red, Green, Blue, Yellow} so that every edge connects two vertices of different colors.

Below is one way to reach that conclusion.

Let the vertices be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and note the edge list:

  (0,2), (0,3), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7),
  (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7),
  (2,4), (2,6), (2,7),
  (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7),
  (4,6), (4,7),
  (5,6), (5,7).

A look at the graph’s structure shows that vertices 6 and 7 are very “busy”: each is adjacent to six of the other vertices. In order to color vertex 6 (say) properly, the six neighbors (vertices 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) must have at most three distinct colors among them (so that one “spare” color remains for 6); otherwise, if all four colors appear among the neighbors, there would be no legal color for vertex 6. A similar restriction applies to vertex 7.

Let’s see if we can force such a situation. Consider the induced subgraph on vertices {0,1,2,3,4,5}. Its edges (drawn from the big list) are:
  0 adjacent to 2, 3, 5;
  1 adjacent to 2, 3, 4, 5;
  2 adjacent to 0, 1, 4;
  3 adjacent to 0, 1, 4, 5;
  4 adjacent to 1, 2, 3;
  5 adjacent to 0, 1, 3.

One can attempt many assignments of three colors to these six vertices. For example, one might try setting
  0 = Red, 1 = Green.
Then 2 (adjacent to 0 and 1) must be Blue.
Next, 3 (adjacent to 0 and 1) can also only be Blue (or a different color if available) but then 4 (adjacent to 1,2,3) would need a fourth color. Various trial‐and‐error assignments eventually show that it is not possible to color these six vertices with only three colors while respecting their adjacencies.

Since the vertices adjacent to vertex 6 must be colored with at most three colors (to leave one color for 6) and we have just seen such a 3–coloring of {0,1,2,3,4,5} in the induced subgraph is impossible, it follows that we cannot extend any 4–coloring to the whole graph.

Thus, there is no valid way to assign each vertex one of {Red,Green,Blue,Yellow} so that no two adjacent vertices receive the same color.
