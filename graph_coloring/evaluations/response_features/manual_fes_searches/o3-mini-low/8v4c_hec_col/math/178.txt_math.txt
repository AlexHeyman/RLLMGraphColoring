We will show that no proper coloring using only red, green, blue, and yellow exists.

One way to see this is to look at the subgraph induced by the vertices {1, 2, 3, 5, 7}. In the given list of edges the following pairs among these vertices are adjacent:
  (1,2), (1,3), (1,5), (1,7), (2,3), (3,5), (3,7), and (1,7) appears already.
Also, from the remaining list we have:
  (2,7) and (5,7).

Thus, among the five vertices 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7, every vertex is connected to every other vertex – it is a complete graph K₅. (You can verify that every pair does appear as an edge.)

In a complete graph on n vertices every vertex must take a distinct color; hence K₅ requires 5 colors. Since we are only allowed 4 colors, any coloring will force two adjacent vertices in this complete subgraph to share the same color. 

Therefore, it is impossible to color all vertices with only red, green, blue, and yellow while respecting the condition that adjacent vertices receive different colors.
