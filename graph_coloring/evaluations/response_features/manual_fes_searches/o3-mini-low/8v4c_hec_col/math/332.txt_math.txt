I'll explain how one can analyze the problem and then give the final answer.

One way to attack the problem is to try to assign a color (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow) to each vertex while satisfying the rule that every edge connects vertices of different colors. For example, one might start by “fixing” a color on a vertex (say, vertex 0) and then work through its many neighbors. In this graph vertex 0 is adjacent to vertices 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 so none of those may get the same color as 0. Continuing in this way one soon discovers that several vertices – particularly those with high degree – end up with neighbor sets that already “use up” all four colors. For example, several attempted assignments lead to a vertex (like vertex 6 or 7) whose neighbors include vertices using Red, Green, Blue and Yellow, leaving no color available for that vertex.

One may try several different assignments and orders. After a careful case–by–case investigation (which reveals that no matter how one chooses colors an edge eventually forces a conflict) one concludes that there is no valid 4–coloring of the given graph.

Thus, the final answer is:

Impossible
