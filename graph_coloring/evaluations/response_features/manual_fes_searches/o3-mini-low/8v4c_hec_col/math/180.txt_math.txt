We first try to reason whether a valid coloring exists. One might start by giving vertex 0 a color (say, Red) since it is adjacent to every other vertex. That forces vertices 1–7 to all use colors other than Red. Then examine the restrictions on a subset of these vertices. Consider, for example, vertices 1, 2, 3, and 4. From the edge list, these vertices are connected as follows:
  (1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4).

Since vertex 0 is colored Red, vertices 1–4 must be colored using only {Green, Blue, Yellow}. But notice that vertex 3 (for instance) is adjacent to 1, 2, and 4. That means vertex 3’s color must differ from the colors of all of them. Suppose we try:
  • Vertex 1 = Green
  • Vertex 2 = Blue
Then vertex 3 cannot be Green or Blue—it would have to be Yellow. However, vertex 4 is adjacent to vertices 1 (Green), 2 (Blue), and 3 (Yellow), and it now has no available color (it cannot be Red because it’s also adjacent to vertex 0).

No matter how one tries to assign the colors, some vertex ends up with a conflict. Therefore, it is impossible to 4‐color the given graph so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.
