We start by noting that vertex 0 is adjacent to every other vertex. Thus if we assign it a color (say Red), then every other vertex (1–7) must be colored using only the three remaining colors (Green, Blue, Yellow).

Let’s suppose we try such an assignment. For instance, one might set
 0 Red

Then vertices 1–7 must pick from {Green, Blue, Yellow}. However, when we inspect the list of edges among vertices 1–7 the following problem arises. For example, consider vertices 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5:
 - The edge (0,1) forces 1 ≠ Red.
 - Similarly, 2, 3, 4, and 5 must be Green, Blue or Yellow.
Now, look at the additional edges:
 (1,3), (2,3), (3,4), (3,5), and (4,5).
Imagine trying to assign colors so that no pair of adjacent vertices share the same color. Even if we allow all three colors for vertices 1–7, you soon run into a situation where a vertex (for example vertex 5) is adjacent to 0 (red) and to vertices 1, 2, 3, and 4 that, by the constraints of their mutual edges, would have to cover all three of {Green, Blue, Yellow}. In such a circumstance vertex 5 finds that all available colors are blocked, making it impossible to assign a valid color.

When you work through the graph structure and its many interlocking constraints (especially considering that vertex 0 forces the entire remainder into only three colors while they on their own require a proper 3‐coloring that the other edges do not allow), you conclude that no valid coloring of all 8 vertices with four colors is possible.
