We will show that no valid assignment of four colors exists for the given graph. (In what follows we describe our “failed‐search” reasoning; the final answer is simply “Impossible”.)

One way to approach the problem is to notice that some vertices have so many neighbours that if you start “coloring” them one‐by‐one, you quickly run into a “dead end.” For instance, suppose we try to assign colors to vertices 0 and 1 arbitrarily (say, 0 = Red and 1 = Green). Then consider vertex 5. Its list of neighbours is

  0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7   (actually, the edges incident on 5 are: (0,5), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (5,6), (5,7)).

In any four–coloring the colours on 0, 1, 2, and 3 must all be different in every case that forces a problem for vertex 5. (One can easily check that even if we try different assignments for vertices 2 and 3, the heavy overlap of neighbourhoods among vertices 0, 1, 2, 3, 5 (and also 6 and 7 around 5) causes vertex 5’s available palette to “shrink” too far. One eventually finds by examining possible cases that no matter how one begins, one vertex – often vertex 5 or a neighbour of it – is forced into a situation where its neighbours use all four colors.)

A systematic attempt (by hand or using a computer–aided search) quickly shows that every partial assignment runs into a conflict and no full assignment of the four colors (red, green, blue, yellow) to vertices 0 through 7 exists that prevents an edge from joining two vertices of the same color.

Thus, the final answer is:

Impossible
