We will show that no matter how you try, you eventually come to a conflict when assigning one of the four colors {Red, Green, Blue, Yellow} to the eight vertices so that every edge connects two vertices of different colors.

One attempt might go like this. Label the vertices 0 through 7 and start by “fixing” a color on vertex 0. For example, set

  0 Red

Because vertex 0 is connected to vertices 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7, none of those may be Red. Then choose a coloring for vertex 1. For instance, one might choose

  1 Green

Now, vertex 1 (which is adjacent to 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7) forces its neighbors (other than 0, already Red) not to be Green. Continuing in a “greedy” manner, one might try:

  2 Blue   (since 2 is adjacent to 0 Red and other not-yet colored vertices)
  3 Yellow  (being adjacent to 0 (Red), 1 (Green), and 2 (Blue))
  4 Red    (since 4 is adjacent to 1 (Green), 2 (Blue), and 3 (Yellow))
  5 Blue   (vertex 5 is adjacent to 0 (Red), 1 (Green) and 3 (Yellow); Blue is one possibility)
  6 Yellow  (vertex 6, adjacent to 0 (Red), 1 (Green), 2 (Blue), 4 (Red) and 5 (Blue), must be Yellow)
  7 ?     (but vertex 7 is adjacent to 0 (Red), 1 (Green), 2 (Blue), 3 (Yellow), 4 (Red), and 6 (Yellow) – so all four colors are already present among its neighbors)

No matter how one rearranges the colors (and several systematic attempts eventually lead to the same blockade), the color choices that must be made force vertex 7 into a conflict. In trying alternative assignments (for example, switching which color we choose for vertex 1 or 2) one always ends up with vertex 7 adjacent to vertices of all four colors. In other words, every legal partial assignment up to vertex 7 leaves no available color for vertex 7.

Because every attempt of a 4–coloring leads to a contradiction, we conclude that it is impossible to assign the four colors to these 8 vertices in such a way that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.

Impossible
