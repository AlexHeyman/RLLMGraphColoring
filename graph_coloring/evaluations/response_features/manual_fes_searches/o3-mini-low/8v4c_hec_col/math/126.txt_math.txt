Let's analyze the requirements. We have 8 vertices and 21 edges. We must assign one of four colors (red, green, blue, yellow) to each vertex so that every edge has endpoints of different colors.

One might try different assignments. For example, one attempt was:

 • 0: Red  
 • 1: Green  
 • 2: Blue  
 • 3: Green  
 • 4: Blue  
 • 5: Red  
 • 6: Yellow  
 • 7: (neighbors 0,2,3,4,6 are Red, Blue, Green, Blue, Yellow) – none of the four colors is available

Even after trying several variations – even “forcing” a desired free color at vertex 7 – one finds that no matter how the colors are chosen, one vertex (in every attempted coloring the “bottleneck” turns out to be a vertex that is adjacent to vertices already forced to take all four colors) ends up with a conflict. All systematic attempts to “free up” a color for the troublesome vertex run into a block when one inspects its neighbors’ colors. 

Thus, after careful analysis it turns out that there is no valid assignment of four colors to the 8 vertices that respects the condition that every edge connects vertices of different color.
