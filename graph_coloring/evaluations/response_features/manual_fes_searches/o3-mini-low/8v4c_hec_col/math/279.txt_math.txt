We start by noticing that vertices 0 and 1 are “universal” (except for the 0–1 pair) in the sense that each is connected to every vertex in {2,3,4,5,6,7}. That is,
 • 0 is adjacent to 2,3,4,5,6,7,
 • 1 is adjacent to 2,3,4,5,6,7.

Because adjacent vertices must have different colors, whatever colors we assign to 0 and 1 cannot be used on any of the vertices 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7. Since we only have 4 colors, once we “reserve” two colors for 0 and 1 the vertices 2–7 are forced to use the remaining two colors.

Let’s suppose without loss of generality that we assign:
 0: Red
 1: Blue

Then every vertex among 2,3,4,5,6,7 must be colored either Green or Yellow. In order for us to have a proper 4‐coloring of the whole graph, the subgraph induced by vertices 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 must be 2–colorable; that is, it must be bipartite.

Now, let’s extract the edges whose both endpoints lie in {2,3,4,5,6,7}. From the given list the relevant edges are:
 • (2,3)
 • (2,5)
 • (2,6)
 • (2,7)
 • (3,4)
 • (3,7)
 • (4,5)
 • (4,6)
 • (4,7)
 • (6,7)

Attempting to divide the set {2,3,4,5,6,7} into two parts (Green and Yellow) leads to a contradiction. For example, if we try to put vertex 2 in one part say Green then its neighbors 3, 5, 6, and 7 must all be Yellow. But then notice that (6,7) is an edge; both 6 and 7 would have the color Yellow, which is not allowed. (Other choices lead to similar conflicts upon close examination of the induced subgraph.)

Thus the induced subgraph on vertices 2–7 is not bipartite. Since 0 and 1 “use up” two of our colors, vertices 2–7 have only two remaining colors available, but they cannot be 2–colored because their induced graph is not bipartite.

Therefore, it is impossible to 4–color the original graph under the given constraints.

Impossible
