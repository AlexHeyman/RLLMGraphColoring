Let's list the edges again for clarity:

  (0,1), (0,2), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7)
  (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)
  (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7)
  (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7)
  (4,6)
  (5,6), (5,7)

One natural idea is to first try a candidate assignment and see if a conflict occurs. A reasonable attempt is to begin by assigning a color to vertex 0, then “color” its neighbors differently, and see if any vertex is forced into a conflict.

For example, suppose we try:
  0: Red

Then vertex 0’s neighbors {1,2,4,5,6,7} must be chosen from {Green, Blue, Yellow} (or in general, not Red).

One possible attempt:
  1: Green
  2: Blue
Now, vertex 1 is adjacent to 0, 3, 4, 5, 6.
  So 1 = Green means that vertices 3, 4, 5, 6 can’t be Green.
Similarly, vertex 2 is adjacent to 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, so 2 = Blue means these vertices can’t be Blue.

Now consider vertex 3. Its neighbors are 1,2,4,5,6,7. Since 1 is Green and 2 is Blue, an available color for 3 could be Yellow.
  3: Yellow

Now, focus on vertex 4. Its neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 6. Their colors so far:
  0: Red, 1: Green, 2: Blue, 3: Yellow.
So vertex 4 sees all four colors already on its neighbors! That means vertex 4 has no available color.

Because vertex 4 is forced by its neighbors to avoid Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow, there is no valid color we can assign to vertex 4. This conflict is not a result of a “bad ordering” but is inherent in the structure. No matter how one attempts to assign colors to the vertices, vertex 4 always ends up adjacent to vertices with all possible colors.

Thus, it is impossible to color the vertices with four colors so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.

Impossible
