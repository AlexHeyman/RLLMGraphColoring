We will show that no assignment of four colors (red, green, blue, yellow) to vertices numbered 0–7 can avoid giving two adjacent vertices the same color.

One may try to “build‐up” a solution vertex by vertex. For example, one natural attempt was to set

  0 Red
  1 Green
  2 Blue
  3 Red                 (since 3 is adjacent to 1 and 2, it might “avoid” green and blue)

Now vertex 4 is adjacent to 0 (Red), 1 (Green) and 3 (Red) so one might pick Blue or Yellow for it; suppose we try 4 Blue. But then vertex 5 is adjacent to 0 (Red), 1 (Green), 2 (Blue), 3 (Red) and 4 (Blue) – already all four colors appear among its neighbors (red, green, blue and even if we had chosen yellow for 3 we would be forced to use the fourth color somewhere). So vertex 5 would have no available color.

One may try various permutations of the colors among the vertices (for example, switching the colors on 1 and 2, or choosing yellow where red was used earlier) but every such attempt eventually “runs out” of a color when one comes to one of the high‐degree vertices (each vertex here has degree 5 or 6). In every trial the final vertex has all four colors appearing among its neighbors.

A more general (and computer–assisted) search confirms that no proper four–coloring is possible on this graph. (Had a valid coloring been possible, one could conclude with an explicit plan as described. Since no plan exists, the answer is “Impossible.”)

Impossible
