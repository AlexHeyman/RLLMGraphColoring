Observe that the given graph contains the vertices {1, 3, 5, 6, 7} which are all mutually adjacent. (For example, between any two of these vertices you can verify that there is an edge in the list.) Thus these five vertices form a complete graph K₅. Since it is well known that a complete graph on n vertices requires n different colors to obtain a proper vertex‐coloring (with no two adjacent vertices sharing the same color), K₅ requires 5 distinct colors. Because we are only allowed 4 colors (red, green, blue, yellow), no proper 4‐coloring of the given graph is possible.
