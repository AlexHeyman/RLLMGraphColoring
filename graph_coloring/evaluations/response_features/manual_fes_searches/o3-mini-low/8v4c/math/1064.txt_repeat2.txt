We first list the edges again and note the adjacencies for each vertex:

• 0: {1, 4, 5, 6, 7}  
• 1: {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}  
• 2: {1, 4, 5, 6, 7}  
• 3: {1, 4, 6, 7}  
• 4: {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7}  
• 5: {0, 1, 2, 4, 7}  
• 6: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7}  
• 7: {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

Notice that vertex 4 is adjacent to vertices 0, 1, 2, and 3 (among others). This is the crucial observation:
• If we wish to color vertex 4, none of its neighbors may share its color.
• In particular, vertices 0, 1, 2, and 3 must receive four different colors because if even two share the same color, then vertex 4 might take that color—but if they are all different, all four available colors are “used up” by neighbors of vertex 4.

Since we have only four colors available (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow), if vertices 0, 1, 2, and 3 are forced to use all four distinct colors, then vertex 4 has no color left that is different from all of them.

Any attempt to reassign colors to avoid this conflict fails because vertex 4 is adjacent to these four vertices. Thus, there is no valid way to color the graph with four colors such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.
