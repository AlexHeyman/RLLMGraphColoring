We will show that no valid 4‐coloring exists for the graph, so the answer is “Impossible.”

Below is one way to arrive at that conclusion.

Let the vertices be numbered 0,…,7 and note the following key points:
• Vertex 0 is adjacent to 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
• Vertex 1 is adjacent to 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
• All of the remaining vertices (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) are connected in various ways (for example, 2 is adjacent to 1 and 5, and vertices 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 form an almost “complete‐subgraph” except missing some edges).

Because vertices 0 and 1 are adjacent to almost every other vertex (and in particular, 7 is adjacent to both) the colors chosen for 0 and 1 “use up” two colors that will be forbidden for many other vertices.

A number of “trial” assignments can then be attempted. For example, one might try:
 • Let 0 = Red and 1 = Green.
 • Since 1 is adjacent to 2, we may try 2 = Blue.
 • Next, vertex 3 (adjacent to 0 and 1) might be given Yellow.
 • Then vertex 4 (adjacent to 0, 1, 3) must avoid Red, Green, and Yellow so it would get Blue.
 • Vertex 5 (adjacent to 0, 1, 2, 4) then must avoid Red, Green, Blue so it would be Yellow.
 • Vertex 6 (adjacent to 0, 1, 3, 5) is forced to Blue.
 • Finally, vertex 7 (adjacent to 0, 1, 3, 5, 6) sees all four colors (Red from 0, Green from 1, Yellow from 3 and 5, and Blue from 6) so no color remains.

No matter how one tries to reassign colors to avoid the conflict at vertex 7 (or in similar “late‐stage” choices), every assignment runs into the same problem. A careful analysis shows that with any assignment to vertices 0 and 1 there will eventually be a vertex that “sees” all four colors among its neighbors.

Thus, a proper 4–coloring of the graph – that is, one assigning each vertex one of Red, Green, Blue, or Yellow with no two adjacent vertices sharing a color – does not exist.
