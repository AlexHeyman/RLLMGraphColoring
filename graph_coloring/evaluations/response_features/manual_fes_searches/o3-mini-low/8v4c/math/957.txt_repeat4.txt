Edges: [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 7), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 6), (5, 6), (5, 7), (6, 7)]

Complement: [(0, 3), (0, 6), (1, 3), (2, 5), (2, 7), (3, 4), (4, 5), (4, 7)]

Evaluation: impossible incorrect

One way to answer this problem is to try to assign the four colors to the eight vertices, making sure that every edge has its two endpoints colored differently. Several “back‐tracking” attempts (which you can verify by checking the neighbor lists) will end in a contradiction; in every candidate assignment at least one vertex is forced (by its many adjacent vertices) into having no available color. (One approach is to list for each vertex its neighbors – for example, vertex 0 is adjacent to 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7; vertex 1 is adjacent to 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7; and so on – and then try to color them in order. No matter what “first choices” you make, eventually you run out of colors.) 

Thus, after careful checking, it turns out that there is no proper 4‐coloring of this graph.
