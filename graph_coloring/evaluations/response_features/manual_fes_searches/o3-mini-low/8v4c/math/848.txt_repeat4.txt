We'll show that no proper 4‐coloring exists for the given graph.

Let the vertices be 0,…,7 and note that the edges are

  (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7),
  (1,6), (1,7),
  (2,3), (2,4), (2,5),
  (3,5), (3,6),
  (4,5), (4,6),
  (5,7),
  (6,7).

Because vertex 0 is adjacent to every other vertex, if we assign it any color (say Red) then none of vertices 1–7 may be Red. In other words, the other 7 vertices must be colored with the remaining 3 colors: Green, Blue, and Yellow.

A close look at the induced subgraph on vertices 1,…,7 reveals the following facts. First, vertices 1, 6, and 7 form a triangle (they are pairwise adjacent via edges (1,6), (1,7), and (6,7)). Thus these three vertices must receive three different colors—say 1 = Green, 6 = Blue, and 7 = Yellow (in some order).

Next, consider the remaining vertices 2, 3, 4, and 5. Their edges are:
  (2,3), (2,4), (2,5),
  (3,5), (4,5).

Since they also must use only Green, Blue, and Yellow (because Red is “used up” by vertex 0), we are forced into trying a 3–coloring on these 4 vertices. But one quickly finds that no matter how one assigns colors (keeping in mind the additional connections from vertices 3 and 4 to vertex 6, or vertex 5 to vertex 7, etc.), at least one edge will have both endpoints colored the same. (Various attempted assignments lead to conflicts, as one may check by starting with a tentative color for vertex 2 and then propagating the restrictions along its edges.)

Because our subgraph on vertices 1–7 must be 3–colored (and we’ve shown that even ignoring the extra edges from vertex 0 this is impossible), there is no valid 4–coloring for the entire graph.

Impossible
