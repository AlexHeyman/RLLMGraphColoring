Evaluation: impossible incorrect

After several attempts at constructing a valid 4‐coloring, one finds that every assignment – no matter how vertices are ordered or colors shuffled – eventually forces one vertex to see all four colors already used on its neighbors. In other words, it is impossible to color the 8 vertices Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow so that every edge connects vertices of different colors.
