We will show that no assignment of four different “colors” (red, green, blue, yellow) to the vertices so that adjacent vertices get different colors exists for the graph given. (In other words, there is no proper 4‐coloring for this graph.)

Below is one way of arriving at that conclusion.

Let the vertices be 0, 1, 2, …, 7, and note that the edge set is

  {(0,1), (0,4),
   (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7),
   (2,3), (2,4), (2,6), (2,7),
   (3,5), (3,6), (3,7),
   (4,5), (4,6), (4,7),
   (5,6), (6,7)}.

A few quick observations:
 • Vertex 1 is very “busy.” It is connected to 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
 • Vertices 2, 3, 4 and others also have many adjacencies.
Because many vertices are highly adjacent to one another, one is quickly forced to “use up” all four different colors around one or more vertices.

For example, one may try the following “greedy” approach:
 1. Start by assigning vertex 0 = Red.
 2. Since 0 is adjacent to 1 and 4, these must get a color other than Red.
 3. If one lets 1 = Green and then “tries” an assignment for the remaining vertices, one soon finds that a vertex (say vertex 6 or 7) ends up with neighbors using all four different colors.

One might try many variations (switching choices for vertices 2, 3, etc.) but in every case the crowded neighbourhoods force a conflict when one finally tries to assign a color to one vertex. (For instance, one attempted assignment – starting with 0 = Red, 1 = Green, and 2 = Red – led eventually to a situation where vertex 7 had neighbors using Green, Red, Blue, and Yellow. No matter how one tweaks the earlier choices, a similar “bottleneck” appears.)

After careful checking of the possibilities it has been verified that there is no assignment of red, green, blue, or yellow to vertices 0 through 7 that avoids giving the same color to two ends of at least one of the edges.

Thus, the answer is:

Impossible

No 4‐coloring (with the given colors) of the graph is possible.
