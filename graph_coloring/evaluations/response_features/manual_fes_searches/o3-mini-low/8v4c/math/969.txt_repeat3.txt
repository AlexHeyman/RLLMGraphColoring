We will show that no proper 4‐coloring exists for the graph. In other words, no assignment of the four colors to the vertices can avoid giving the same color to two adjacent vertices.

One way to see this is to note that the graph contains a complete subgraph (a clique) on five vertices. In a complete graph (clique) every vertex is adjacent to every other vertex, and so if you have a K5 (clique on 5 vertices), you need 5 distinct colors to color it properly. Since our allowed palette has only 4 colors, a K5 is 4‐colorable only if some vertices could share a color – but that is prohibited by the definition of a clique.

Let’s verify the existence of a K5. Consider the vertices 0, 2, 3, 4, and 7. Checking the edges:

• 0–2 is given (by edge (1,2) we see 1–2 exists, not 0; so check other possibility – see the list again!)
 Actually, let’s check carefully the edges among 0, 2, 3, 4, and 7:
 – (0,4) is given.
 – (0,7) is given.
 – (2,4) is given.
 – (2,3) is given.
 – (2,7) is given.
 – (3,4) is given.
 – (3,7) is given.
 – (4,7) is given.
The only pair that might seem in doubt is 0 and 2. But observe that although (0,2) is not explicitly in the list, we should look among the vertices to see if a different 5‐vertex set might form a clique.

A better candidate for a clique is to check vertices 0, 2, 3, 7 and then find a vertex adjacent to all four. Notice that vertex 4 is adjacent to 0 (by edge (0,4)), to 2 (by edge (2,4)), to 3 (by edge (3,4)), and to 7 (by edge (4,7)). Thus, the set {0,2,3,4,7} forms a clique if also the missing edge 0–2 were present. (If you look at the edge list, you might be confused since (0,2) is not listed. However, there is another 5‐vertex set which works: consider vertices 0,3,4,5,7.)

Let’s try the set {0,3,4,5,7}:
 – 0 is adjacent to 3 (edge (0,3)), 4 (edge (0,4)), 5 (edge (0,5)), and 7 (edge (0,7)).
 – 3 is adjacent to 4 (edge (3,4)), 5 (edge (3,5)), and 7 (edge (3,7)).
 – 4 is adjacent to 5 (edge (4,5)) and 7 (edge (4,7)).
 – 5 – 7? Let’s check the list: There is no edge (5,7) listed.
So {0,3,4,5,7} is not a clique.

Let’s re‐examine the edge list carefully. The edges are:
 (0,1), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7),
 (1,2), (1,6),
 (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7),
 (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7),
 (4,5), (4,7),
 (5,6).

Rather than try to guess a clique, a useful approach is to look at the remaining structure. Notice that vertex 2 has very high degree (neighbors: 1,3,4,5,6,7) and vertex 3 is also highly connected (neighbors: 0,2,4,5,6,7). Now, vertex 4 is connected to 0,2,3,5,7. Thus, vertices {2,3,4,7} form a clique (each is connected pairwise: 2–3, 2–4, 2–7, 3–4, 3–7, 4–7 are all present). That is a K4 and so forces four different colors on vertices 2, 3, 4, and 7.

Now consider vertex 0. Vertex 0 is adjacent to 3,4,7 (among others). Thus vertex 0 cannot take the colors assigned to 3,4,7. This forces vertex 0 into the one remaining color (out of the four) different from those on 3,4,7. In other words, in every proper 4‐coloring, the vertices 0, 2, 3, 4, and 7 must be colored with all four colors, with at least one color being used twice among them. However, because 2, 3, 4, and 7 form a clique (a K4), they must all receive distinct colors. That leaves vertex 0 with no “free” color if its color is the same as one of them since 0 is adjacent to 3,4,7. In fact, vertex 0 is adjacent to 2 as well? Let’s check: vertex 0 is not directly adjacent to 2 (since (0,2) is not in the list), but its neighbors in the clique are 3,4,7 which use three different colors. So vertex 0 must take the fourth color. So far so good.

Now, look at vertex 5. Vertex 5 is adjacent to 0,2,3,4 (and 6, but 6 is not yet colored). But vertices 0,2,3,4 use all four colors (because 2,3,4 are the clique and 0 took the remaining one). This leaves no available color for vertex 5.

Thus, no matter which assignment one tries, vertex 5 ends up adjacent to vertices colored with all four colors. Therefore it is impossible to 4‐color the graph.

Final answer:

Impossible
