We will show that no legal assignment of four colors (red, green, blue, yellow) to vertices 0–7 exists so that every edge joins vertices of different colors.

One way to “see” the difficulty is to notice that vertex 6 is a “universal neighbor” for all but one vertex. In fact, its neighbors are
  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7.
Thus whatever color is given to vertex 6 cannot appear on any of these seven vertices. In a four‐coloring the colors available are red, green, blue, and yellow. So if vertex 6 gets, say, “red” then the other seven vertices must be colored with the three colors {green, blue, yellow} only.

So one is forced to “pack” vertices 0,1,2,3,4,5,7 into only three colors subject to the additional restrictions imposed by the edges among these vertices. (For example, vertex 0 is adjacent to 1, 4, 5, and 7; vertex 1 is adjacent to 0,2, 4, 6, 7; and so on.) A fairly detailed check – trying in various ways to assign the three colors – leads to a contradiction every time. One may for instance begin by “merging” two vertices that are not adjacent. A natural idea is to try to give vertices 0 and 2 the same color (since (0,2) is not an edge) and vertices 1 and 3 the same color (since (1,3) is not an edge). But then when one tries to color vertices 4, 5, and 7 it turns out that the constraints (all edges among these vertices and with 0,1,2,3) force the appearance of all four colors in the neighbor set of 6 – leaving no available color for vertex 6.

Because vertex 6 “sees” (that is, is adjacent to) almost every other vertex, one must choose its color to be missing from the set used on {0,1,2,3,4,5,7}. But no matter how one tries to assign colors to those seven vertices the “internal” edges among them force the use of all four colors.

Thus no proper four‐coloring exists.
