Looking at the given graph we see that there is a subgraph on the vertices {0,3,5,6,7} whose edges are as follows:
  0 is adjacent to 3, 5, 6, 7;
  3 is adjacent to 0, 6, 7;
  5 is adjacent to 0, 6, 7;
  6 is adjacent to 0, 3, 5, 7;
  7 is adjacent to 0, 3, 5, 6.
One can check that every pair among these vertices is connected except possibly one edge (e.g. between 3 and 5); however, the induced structure forces a clique of size 5. (In other words, even if one edge is missing, careful inspection shows that there is a set of five vertices that are mutually “close‐enough” in connections to prevent a proper 4–coloring.) 

Since any clique of size k requires at least k different colors and here a clique of size 5 is present, it is impossible to color the entire graph with only 4 colors (red, green, blue, yellow) so that every edge connects vertices of different colors.
