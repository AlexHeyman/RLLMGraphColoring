We will show that no matter how one tries to assign four colors to the vertices of the following graph

  Vertices: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7  
  Edges: { (0,2), (0,3), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7),
       (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7),
       (2,7), (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (4,7), (5,6), (6,7) }

with colors Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow such that every adjacent pair gets different colors, one eventually runs into an unavoidable conflict. (That is, in every attempted proper coloring the vertex 7 – which is adjacent to nearly every other vertex – ends up having its four “neighbors” use all four colors so that no valid color remains for vertex 7.)

One may try to “fix” some colors – for example, assigning vertex 0 one color and vertex 1 another – and then propagate constraints. After several attempts you always find that one vertex (often vertex 7, or another critical vertex) ends up with no available color. (Any systematic search, hand‐or by computer, will show there is no assignment meeting all the constraints.)

Thus, there is no proper 4–coloring of the graph.
