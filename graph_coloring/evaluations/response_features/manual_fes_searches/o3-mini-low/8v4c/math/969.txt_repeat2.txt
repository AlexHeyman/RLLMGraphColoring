We will show that no assignment of four colors (red, green, blue, yellow) to the vertices 0–7 can avoid giving two endpoints of some listed edge the same color.

One way to “see” a difficulty is to notice that vertex 5 is adjacent to four vertices (namely, 0, 2, 3, and 4). In any valid coloring these four neighbors must all receive different colors (otherwise if two of them had the same color then vertex 5 could safely use that color—but in every candidate coloring one finds that, because of additional restrictions coming from the rest of the graph, this freedom cannot be achieved). In fact, because vertices 0, 2, 3, and 4 have many additional adjacencies among themselves and with vertices 1, 5, 6, and 7, one cannot “recycle” any color without eventually forcing a conflict.

A (partial) attempt might start this way:
 • Set vertex 0 = Red.
 • Since vertex 0 is adjacent to 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 none of them may be red.
 • Next, one might try vertex 1 = Green and vertex 2 = Blue.
 • Then because vertex 2 is adjacent to 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 none of those may be Blue.
 • At vertex 3 one might choose Yellow; then vertex 4 ends up forced to a remaining one—say Green. 
But then vertex 5 is adjacent to vertices 0 (Red), 2 (Blue), 3 (Yellow), and 4 (Green) so there is no color left available for vertex 5.

Much further “back‐tracking” through the many cases (and you may try other starting assignments) will show that no matter how one proceeds the conflict at vertex 5 (or later forced conflicts) cannot be avoided.

Thus it is impossible to color this graph with only four colors so that the endpoints of every edge get different colors.
