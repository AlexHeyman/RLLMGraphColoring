We will show that no proper 4‐coloring exists.

One way to argue is as follows. Look at the subgraph induced by the vertices {2, 3, 4, 7}. Checking the list of edges we see that

  (2,3), (2,4), (2,7), (3,4), (3,7), and (4,7)

are all present. Thus these four vertices form a complete graph K4 so that in any proper coloring they must receive four different colors.

Now examine vertex 5. Its neighbors are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7. In particular, vertices 2, 3, 4, and 7 already receive all four colors (because they form a K4) – say Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow (in some order). This leaves no available color for vertex 5 (even though vertex 1 might share one of those colors, vertex 5 is still adjacent to the K4 which uses every color). In other words, no matter how we assign colors, vertex 5 will be adjacent to vertices having all four colors.

Because a proper 4‐coloring would require every vertex to have some color that is not the color of any neighbor, and vertex 5 cannot get any color under any assignment, it is impossible to color the given graph with four colors.
