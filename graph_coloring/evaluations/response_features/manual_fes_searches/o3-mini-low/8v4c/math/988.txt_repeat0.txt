Evaluation: impossible incorrect

We start by examining the structure of the graph. The set of edges among the vertices shows some vertices are highly connected. For example, consider vertices 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6. All the following edges exist:
  (0,1), (0,4), (0,6), (1,2), (1,4), (1,6), (2,4), and (2,6).

This indicates that these five vertices form a clique – every vertex in this set is connected to every other vertex. Since a clique of size 5 requires at least 5 different colors (one for each vertex in the clique), it is impossible to color the graph with only 4 colors such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.

Impossible
