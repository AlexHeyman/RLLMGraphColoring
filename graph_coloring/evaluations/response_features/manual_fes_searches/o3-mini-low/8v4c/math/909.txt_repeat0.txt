It turns out that no valid 4‐coloring exists for the given graph. Here’s one way to see why:

Notice that the vertices 3, 5, 6, and 7 form a complete subgraph. In the list of edges you provided, these pairs appear:
  (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)
Thus, vertices 3, 5, 6, and 7 are mutually adjacent (i.e. they form a K₄). In any proper coloring, a K₄ requires 4 different colors.

Now, consider vertex 1. Its neighbors are 3, 5, 6, and 7 (as well as vertex 4, but the four already come from the K₄):
  Edges from 1: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7)
Since 3, 5, 6, and 7 are using all 4 distinct colors (say Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow in some order), vertex 1 cannot be assigned any of the 4 colors without matching one of its neighbors.

Thus, there is no way to color every vertex with Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow while ensuring no two adjacent vertices share the same color.
