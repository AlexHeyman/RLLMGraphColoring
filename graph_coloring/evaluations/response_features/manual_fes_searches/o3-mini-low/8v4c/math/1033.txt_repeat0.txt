We will show that no proper 4‐coloring exists. In any 4–coloring of this graph, observe that vertex 4 is adjacent to vertices 0, 1, 2, and 3. Since no two adjacent vertices may share a color, 0, 1, 2 and 3 must receive (at least) three different colors. (If they used only two colors – say red and green – then one of them would force 4 to take a “fourth” color different from red and green; but then all four colors would appear among 0,1,2,3,4.) In fact, to “save” a color for 4 we might try to force one pair among 0, 1, 2, and 3 to share a color. For example, one might set

  0 Red, 1 Green, 2 Red, 3 Blue,

so that vertex 4 sees only Red, Green, and Blue in its neighbors and so may be colored Yellow.

However, look now at vertex 5. It is adjacent to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. With the above assignment the neighbors of 5 have colors: 
  0: Red, 1: Green, 2: Red, 3: Blue, 4: Yellow.
That is, even though one color is repeated (Red appears twice), vertex 5 sees all four different colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow). Therefore there is no remaining color available for vertex 5.

No matter how one “tries” to force a repeated color among 0,1,2,3 – note that vertex 4 is adjacent to all four of them – the set {0,1,2,3,4} will always end up “using” all four colors. Since vertex 5 is also adjacent to all of 0,1,2,3,4, its neighborhood forces the use of every color, leaving no valid choice. (A similar problem happens with vertex 7.)

Thus, it is impossible to find a 4–coloring of the given graph.

Impossible
