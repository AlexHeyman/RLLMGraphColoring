Evaluation: impossible incorrect

I'll show you one attempt to assign colors, and then the analysis reveals that no matter how we try to assign the four colors such that no two adjacent vertices share a color, a contradiction is reached. (In our working, we repeatedly reached a vertex whose neighbors already used all four colors.) 

In other words, it is impossible to color the vertices of the given graph with only Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow so that every edge connects vertices of different colors.
