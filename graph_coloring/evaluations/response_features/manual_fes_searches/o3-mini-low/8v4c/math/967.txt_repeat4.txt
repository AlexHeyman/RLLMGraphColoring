Edges: [(0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 3), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 4), (3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 6), (5, 7)]

Complement: [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5), (6, 7)]

Evaluation: impossible incorrect

---

Since the vertices 3, 4, 6, and 7 form a complete subgraph (K4) and vertex 0 is adjacent to all of them, vertex 0 would be forced to avoid all four colors. Therefore, it is impossible to color the graph with four colors without having two adjacent vertices share the same color.

Impossible

Manually assessed false edges: N/A
