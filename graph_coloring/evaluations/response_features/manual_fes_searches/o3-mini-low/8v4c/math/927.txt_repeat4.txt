We will show that no assignment of the four colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow) to vertices 0,1,…,7 of the graph below can make every edge join two differently colored vertices.

Recall that the graph has vertices 0–7 and edges

  (0,1), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7),
  (1,2), (1,3), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7),
  (2,3), (2,7),
  (3,4), (3,6),
  (4,5), (4,6),
  (5,7).

One way to see that a proper 4‐coloring is impossible is to try (and fail) to assign colors in an order that “seems natural” from the structure. (Any attempted ordering eventually leads to one vertex finding that all four colors appear among its neighbors.) For example, one natural attempt is to start with vertex 0 and assign it Red. Because 0 is adjacent to many vertices, that forces restrictions; then vertex 1 (say we try Blue), then vertex 2, etc. Even after several choices and “back‐tracks,” one finds that some vertex – often 6 or 7 – ends up adjacent to vertices colored Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow.

A (very sketchy) example of one branch of the failed search:

 • Suppose we try 0 = Red.
 • Then, trying various alternatives, one might set 1 = Green, 2 = Blue, and 3 = Yellow.
 • Next, one tries to color vertex 4. Because 4 is adjacent to 0 (Red) and 3 (Yellow), one might have 4 = Blue or Green.
 • In any branch (say 4 = Blue) we then proceed to vertices 5 and 6. But because 5 is adjacent to 0, 1, and 4, its color is forced – say we pick Yellow. Then for vertex 6 (adjacent to 0, 1, 3, 4, 5) none of the four colors is available.
 • Changing the choices for vertices 4 or 1 or 2 always eventually “forces” a vertex (often 7) to be adjacent to vertices of all four colors.

After trying a number of possibilities it becomes clear that no complete assignment exists that avoids a conflict on every edge.

Thus, since no valid 4–coloring can be found, the correct final answer is simply:

Impossible
