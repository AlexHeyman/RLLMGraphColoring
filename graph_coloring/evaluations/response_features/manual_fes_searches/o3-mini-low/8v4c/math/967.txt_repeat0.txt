We will show that no valid 4‐coloring exists.

Note that the graph’s edges include the following four edges:
  (0,3), (0,4), (0,7), (3,4), (3,7), (4,7).

This means that vertices 0, 3, 4 and 7 form a complete subgraph (a clique of size 4). In any proper vertex–coloring a clique of size 4 must receive four distinct colors. (In our palette the only colors are Red, Green, Blue, Yellow.) Therefore, in any valid coloring we must have, for example, something like

  0 Color A  
  3 Color B  
  4 Color C  
  7 Color D  

with all four colors different.

Now, inspect vertex 6. Its neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7. In particular, vertex 6 is adjacent to all of the clique vertices 0, 3, 4, and 7. No matter how you choose your 4 colors for the clique these four vertices use all four available colors. That leaves no available color for vertex 6. (Even if you try to “save” a color by changing some assignment on vertices 1, 2 or 5, the clique forces every color to appear among its vertices so that vertex 6 is adjacent to vertices of every color.)

Thus, there is no way to assign the four colors to all vertices while ensuring that adjacent vertices receive distinct colors.
