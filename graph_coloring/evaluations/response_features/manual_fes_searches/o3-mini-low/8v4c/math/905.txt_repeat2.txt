We will show that no matter how one tries to assign the colors Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow to the vertices 0 through 7 so that every edge has endpoints of different colors, one is forced into a contradiction.

Below is one way to see the issue. (Any “proof by exhaustion” or back‐tracking search will eventually hit the same dead ends.) Suppose we try to “build” a valid 4–coloring. For instance, one might begin by assigning vertex 0 a color. (Without loss of generality let

  vertex 0 = Red.)

Since vertex 0 is adjacent to 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 the vertices 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 cannot be Red. Meanwhile vertex 1—although not connected to 0—is adjacent to 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, so its color “controls” many vertices as well. One might try, for example, to let vertex 1 = Blue. Next one chooses a color for vertex 2. Vertex 2 is adjacent to 0, 1, and 7 so it may be assigned any color except Red or Blue (say Green). Continuing on for vertex 3, adjacent to 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, and 7, the “free” colors might (in one attempt) be Yellow. Then vertex 4 (adjacent to 0, 1, 3, 6, and 7) would be forced to be the one remaining color – say Blue or Green – and so on.

But if you follow the constraints carefully–no matter which choices are tried, a conflict eventually arises. One finds that when it comes time to color the “crowded” vertex 6 (for example), its neighbors already have taken on all 4 colors. (In one series of possibilities, vertex 6 is adjacent to vertices 0 (Red), 1 (Blue), 3 (Yellow), 4 (Green), and 5 again conflicts with one of those colors.) Other orderings lead equally inevitably to a vertex with no allowed color.

A systematic backtracking search (or a careful “pen‐and–paper” exhaustion of possibilities) shows that no assignment of four colors to vertices 0–7 can avoid having at least one edge whose endpoints share the same color.

Thus, the proper final answer is:

Impossible
