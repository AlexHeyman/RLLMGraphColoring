Evaluation: impossible incorrect

We first observe that the subgraph induced by vertices 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 is complete. In other words, every pair of these five vertices is connected by an edge. (You can verify, for example, that (2,3), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (5,6), (5,7) and (6,7) are all present.) A complete graph on five vertices (Kâ‚…) requires five different colors to avoid a conflict between adjacent vertices. Since we are limited to only four colors (red, green, blue, yellow), there is no valid way to color the entire graph following the rules.
