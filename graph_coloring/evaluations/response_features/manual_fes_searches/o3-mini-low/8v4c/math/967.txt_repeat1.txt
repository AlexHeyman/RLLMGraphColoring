We first list the edges incident to each vertex:

• 0 is adjacent to 3, 4, 5, 6, 7  
• 1 is adjacent to 2, 3, 4, 6, 7  
• 2 is adjacent to 1, 3, 6, 7  
• 3 is adjacent to 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7  
• 4 is adjacent to 0, 1, 3, 6, 7  
• 5 is adjacent to 0, 6, 7  
• 6 is adjacent to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7  
• 7 is adjacent to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

Notice in particular the group of vertices {0, 3, 4, 7}:  
 – The edge set includes (0,3), (0,4), (0,7), (3,4), (3,7), and (4,7).  
So these four vertices form a clique—they are all mutually adjacent. In any proper vertex coloring, each vertex in a clique must receive a distinct color. Since we have only four colors available, this clique forces us to assign four different colors to vertices 0, 3, 4, and 7.

Now consider vertex 6. Its list of neighbors is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7. (In particular, 6 is adjacent to every vertex in the aforementioned clique: 0, 3, 4, and 7.) That means the colors used for vertices 0, 3, 4, and 7 are forbidden for vertex 6.

Since the clique {0, 3, 4, 7} uses all four available colors, there will be no color left for vertex 6. (Even if we rearranged colors among them, the fact remains that the four “busy” colors are off‐limits for 6.)

Thus, it is impossible to assign one of the four colors (red, green, blue, yellow) to every vertex so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.
