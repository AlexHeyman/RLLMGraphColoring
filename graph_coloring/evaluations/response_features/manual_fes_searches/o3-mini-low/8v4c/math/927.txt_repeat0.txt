We will show that no assignment of the four colors Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow to vertices 0–7 (with the listed adjacencies) can avoid a monochromatic edge. In other words, a proper four–coloring of the graph does not exist, so the answer is “Impossible.”

Below we briefly describe one attempt (and why it fails) and explain that every assignment eventually “runs out” of colors for one of the vertices.

One might start by “fixing” a color on vertex 0. For example, set
 0 Red
Since vertex 0 is adjacent to vertices 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, none of these may then get Red. One might try an assignment step–by–step such as assigning

 0 Red
 1 Blue
 2 Yellow           (since 1–2 is an edge, 2 ≠ Blue)
 3 Green           (3 is adjacent to 0,1,2 so must avoid Red,Blue,Yellow)
 4 ?   (adjacent to 0 (Red) and 3 (Green) so may be Blue or Yellow)
 5 ?  
 6 ?  
 7 ?

A natural continuation may let you try 4=Blue and then assign candidates for 5; however, proceeding in this fashion always forces a later vertex (often vertex 6 or vertex 7) to have all four colors already “taken” by its neighbors. (For example, one finds that even when the neighbors of 6 “use up” Red, Blue, Green, and Yellow, there remains no available color for 6.) One may also attempt to change earlier choices (for example, swap Blue and Green at some steps) but eventually the “bottleneck” at vertex 7 (which happens to be adjacent to 0, 1, 2, and 5 in every scenario, and these four neighbors eventually force all four colors) makes a proper four–coloring impossible.

Because every systematic attempt of assigning colors (and then backtracking to try different alternatives) runs into a conflict in which one vertex is forced to have no available color, we must conclude that it is impossible to color the vertices with only four colors so that no two adjacent vertices receive the same color.

Thus, the final answer is:

Impossible
