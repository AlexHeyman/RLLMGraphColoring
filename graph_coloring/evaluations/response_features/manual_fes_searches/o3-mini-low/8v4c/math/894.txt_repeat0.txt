Evaluation: impossible incorrect

Notice that the edges among vertices {2, 3, 5, 6, 7} form a complete subgraph (a clique). In particular, every pair among these vertices is adjacent:
  (2,3), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7),
  (3,5), (3,6), (3,7),
  (5,6), (5,7),
  (6,7).

A clique of 5 vertices requires 5 different colors in any proper coloring (since every vertex is adjacent to each other). However, we only have 4 colors available (red, green, blue, and yellow). Therefore, it is impossible to assign colors to all vertices so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.
