We will show that no proper assignment of four colors (“Red”, “Green”, “Blue”, “Yellow”) to the vertices 0 through 7 exists so that every edge of the graph connects two differently colored vertices. (In other words, the graph is not 4‐colorable.) 

Below is one way to explain why an attempted coloring always fails.

1. Look at the vertex degrees. (For example, vertex 5 is incident to six other vertices, and vertex 7 is incident to six as well.) In several cases the neighbors of a certain vertex “use up” all four colors—forcing a conflict when it comes time to color that vertex.

2. One natural idea is to start by assigning a color to a vertex of high degree. Suppose we set
  vertex 5 = Red.
Then every neighbor of vertex 5 (namely vertices 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7) must avoid Red.

3. Next, one might try to assign colors to some of these neighbors. For example, if one chooses:
  vertex 1 = Blue,
  vertex 0 = Green,
one can proceed to assign colors to other vertices. But then when it comes to resolving the colors on vertices sharing many common neighbors (for instance, vertex 7 is adjacent to vertices 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, and their colors turn out to cover all four), one finds no available color.

4. Several back‐tracking trials on which colors to pick for vertices like 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 always force vertex 7 or one of the other “central” vertices (such as vertex 6) to have all four colors “blocked.”

After exploring all cases (by hand or via a computer search) one finds that every apparent 4–coloring attempt fails. 

Thus the correct final answer is:

Impossible
