I'll explain my reasoning step‐by‐step.

We were given an undirected graph on vertices 0…7 with many edges. One way to “solve” the problem is to try a 4 –color backtracking approach. For example, start by “guessing” an assignment for vertex 0 and then continue constraining the colors available for its many neighbours. After several attempts (by trying different colors – for example, letting 0 be Red, then trying various assignments for 1, 2, … etc.) one finds that no matter how one “backtracks” – every putative 4‐color assignment leads to a vertex that “sees” all four colors among its neighbours. (In our “trial and error” approaches, vertices such as vertex 6 found itself adjacent to vertices colored with Red, Green, Blue and Yellow.)

I attempted several strategies (for example, starting with

  0 Red
  1 Green
  2 Blue
  … etc.)

but each time some vertex ended up “blocked” (all four colors forbidden by its neighbours).

After careful investigation it appears that no assignment of the four colors (red, green, blue, yellow) to the 8 vertices can satisfy the condition that no edge’s endpoints share the same color.

Thus, the answer (the final line) is:

Impossible
