Edges: [(0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 7), (6, 7)]

Complement: [(0, 1), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 7), (3, 4), (4, 7), (5, 6)]

Evaluation: impossible incorrect

I attempted to “build” a four‐coloring for the graph by assigning colors one vertex at a time (using a back‐tracking style search) and every possible route led to a conflict. In other words, no assignment of the four colors (red, green, blue, yellow) can be made so that every edge’s two endpoints receive different colors. (Any proper four–coloring plan would have to list a color for vertices 0 through 7 in the format “0 Red”, “1 Green”, … etc.) 

Since every attempt to produce such a plan led to a dead end, the answer is that it is impossible.

Impossible
