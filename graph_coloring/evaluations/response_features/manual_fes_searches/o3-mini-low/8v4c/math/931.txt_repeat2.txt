We will show that no assignment of the four colors Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow to vertices 0–7 can avoid giving two ends of an edge the same color.

One might first hope to “save” the four‐color possibility by taking vertex 0 (which is adjacent to 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7) and giving it one color (say, Red) and then trying to “recolour” the remaining vertices with the three colors that remain. However, a careful look at the remaining structure shows that the vertices 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 contain many mutual adjacencies. (In fact, the induced subgraph on {2,3,4,5,6,7} contains the edges

  (2,3), (2,5), (2,6),
  (3,4), (3,6), (3,7),
  (4,5), (4,7),
  (5,6), (5,7),
  (6,7).)

Also, vertex 1 is adjacent to vertices 2, 3, and 4. In various attempted assignments (by starting with 0 = Red, then fixing colors for 1, 2, 3, 4 so that 1 is forced not to use one of the colors, etc.) one finds that several vertices (typically 6 or 7) end up with all three remaining colors appearing on their neighbors. (For instance, one attempt gave 0 = Red, 2 = Green, 3 = Blue, 4 = Green, 5 = Blue, and then vertex 6 was forced to avoid Red, Green, and Blue by its neighbors 0, 2, 3, 5; that left only Yellow. But then vertex 7 was adjacent to vertices colored Red, Blue, Green, and Yellow, leaving no color available.)

Because every choice eventually leads to a conflict—no matter how one permutes the colors on the vertices in the dense induced subgraph—it turns out that even with four colors no proper coloring exists.

Thus, the final answer is:

Impossible
