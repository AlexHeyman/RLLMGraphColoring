We will show that no assignment of four colors (red, green, blue, yellow) to the eight people can avoid a “color‐collision” between two friends.

Below is one way to see the impossibility.

Step 1. List the eight people (vertices) and the friendship (edges) between them. (For example, “Alice is friends with Dave” means there is an edge between vertices Alice and Dave.)

The friendships are as follows:
 • Alice is friends with Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather.
 • Bob is friends with Carol, Dave, Ethan, George, Heather.
 • Carol is friends with Dave, George, Heather.
 • Dave is friends with Ethan, George, Heather.
 • Ethan is friends with George, Heather.
 • Fran is friends with George, Heather.
 • George is friends with Heather.

(Recall that friendship is mutual.)

Step 2. Identify a large complete subgraph (a clique) – a set of people all of whom are pairwise friends. In any proper coloring of the graph (i.e. an assignment of shirt–colors so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color), every vertex in a clique must get a different color.

One may check that the vertices Bob, Carol, Dave, George, and Heather form a clique. (Here’s one check:
 – Bob is friends with Carol, Dave, George, and Heather.
 – Carol is friends with Bob, Dave, George, and Heather.
 – Dave is friends with Bob, Carol, George, and Heather.
 – George is friends with Bob, Carol, and Dave, and is also friends with Heather.
 – Heather is friends with Bob, Carol, and Dave, and is also friends with George.)
Thus, there is a 5–vertex clique.

Step 3. Conclude that at least 5 different colors are required (one for each vertex in the clique). Since we have only 4 shirt colors available, it is impossible to assign colors to these 8 people so that no two friends wear the same color.

Final answer:
Impossible

The friendships are as follows:
 • #0 is friends with #3, #4, #5, #6, #7.
 • #1 is friends with #2, #3, #4, #6, #7.
 • #2 is friends with #3, #6, #7.
 • #3 is friends with #4, #6, #7.
 • #4 is friends with #6, #7.
 • #5 is friends with #6, #7.
 • #6 is friends with #7.

 – #6 is friends with #1, #2, and #3, and is also friends with #7.
 – #7 is friends with #1, #2, and #3, and is also friends with #6.)
