We first represent the eight people as vertices of a graph and draw an edge between two vertices if the corresponding people are friends. (Remember, a “clique” in a graph is a set of vertices that are all mutually connected by edges.) For our graph, here are the friendships:

• Alice is friends with Carol, Dave, Ethan, George, Heather.
• Bob is friends with Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather.
• Carol is friends with Alice, Bob, Heather.
• Dave is friends with Alice, Bob, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather.
• Ethan is friends with Alice, Bob, Dave, George, Heather.
• Fran is friends with Bob, Dave, George.
• George is friends with Alice, Bob, Dave, Ethan, Fran, Heather.
• Heather is friends with Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, George.

Examine the set {Bob, Dave, Ethan, George, Heather}. Check the edges among them:

• Bob is friends with Dave, Ethan, George, and Heather.
• Dave is friends with Bob, Ethan, George, and Heather.
• Ethan is friends with Bob, Dave, George, and Heather.
• George is friends with Bob, Dave, Ethan, and Heather.
• Heather is friends with Bob, Dave, Ethan, and George.

This set forms a clique of 5 people, meaning that in any coloring (where a color assigned to one person cannot be reused by any of their friends) these five people must all receive different colors. Since there are only 4 shirt colors available (red, green, blue, and yellow), it is impossible to assign a shirt color to each of these five people so that no two in the clique share the same color.

Therefore, it is impossible.

Impossible

We first represent the eight people as vertices of a graph and draw an edge between two vertices if the corresponding people are friends. (Remember, a “clique” in a graph is a set of vertices that are all mutually connected by edges.) For our graph, here are the friendships:

• #0 is friends with #2, #3, #4, #6, #7.
• #1 is friends with #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7.
• #2 is friends with #0, #1, #7.
• #3 is friends with #0, #1, #4, #5, #6, #7.
• #4 is friends with #0, #1, #3, #6, #7.
• #5 is friends with #1, #3, #6.
• #6 is friends with #0, #1, #3, #4, #5, #7.
• #7 is friends with #0, #1, #2, #3, #4, #6.

Examine the set {#1, #3, #4, #6, #7}. Check the edges among them:

• #1 is friends with #3, #4, #6, and #7.
• #3 is friends with #1, #4, #6, and #7.
• #4 is friends with #1, #3, #6, and #7.
• #6 is friends with #1, #3, #4, and #7.
