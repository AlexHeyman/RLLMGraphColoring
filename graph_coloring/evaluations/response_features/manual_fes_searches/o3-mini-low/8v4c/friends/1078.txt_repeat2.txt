Examine the friendship relations. For instance, look at Carol’s friends: Bob, Ethan, Fran, George, and Heather. Notice that among these, the four people Ethan, Fran, George, and Heather are all mutual friends (each pair of them are friends). That set forms a clique of size 4, so by the rules of graph coloring, they must all have different shirt colors. This forces the four colors—red, green, blue, and yellow—to appear on Ethan, Fran, George, and Heather in some order. Since Carol is also friends with these four, no matter what color Bob wears, all four colors are already “taken” in her neighborhood, leaving no color available for Carol.

Thus, a 4‐coloring of the “friendship” graph does not exist.

Examine the friendship relations. For instance, look at #2’s friends: #1, #4, #5, #6, and #7. Notice that among these, the four people #4, #5, #6, and #7 are all mutual friends (each pair of them are friends). That set forms a clique of size 4, so by the rules of graph coloring, they must all have different shirt colors. This forces the four colors—red, green, blue, and yellow—to appear on #4, #5, #6, and #7 in some order. Since #2 is also friends with these four, no matter what color #1 wears, all four colors are already “taken” in her neighborhood, leaving no color available for #2.

Thus, a 4‐coloring of the “friendship” graph does not exist.
