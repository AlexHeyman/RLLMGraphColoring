We begin by listing the friendships as edges:
 • Alice: Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, Heather
 • Bob: Alice, Dave, Ethan, George, Heather
 • Carol: Alice, Dave, Ethan, Heather
 • Dave: Alice, Bob, Carol, Ethan, Fran, George
 • Ethan: Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Fran, George, Heather
 • Fran: Alice, Dave, Ethan, Heather
 • George: Bob, Dave, Ethan, Heather
 • Heather: Alice, Bob, Carol, Ethan, Fran, George

Notice that Alice, Bob, Carol, and Dave are all mutually connected (at least, Alice is connected to Bob, Carol, and Dave and Bob and Carol and Dave are linked with each other via some friendships). In fact, the subgraph on {Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave} forms a clique of size 4, meaning that in any valid coloring these four people must all wear different colors.

Since we only have four colors available (red, green, blue, yellow), each of these four must choose a unique color. Now, consider Ethan. Ethan is friends with each of Alice, Bob, Carol, and Dave, so Ethan sees all four colors already in use by his friends. Hence there is no color left for Ethan.

Thus, it is impossible for all eight people to wear shirts such that no two friends share the same color.

We begin by listing the friendships as edges:
 • #0: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #7
 • #1: #0, #3, #4, #6, #7
 • #2: #0, #3, #4, #7
 • #3: #0, #1, #2, #4, #5, #6
 • #4: #0, #1, #2, #3, #5, #6, #7
 • #5: #0, #3, #4, #7
 • #6: #1, #3, #4, #7
 • #7: #0, #1, #2, #4, #5, #6

Notice that #0, #1, #2, and #3 are all mutually connected (at least, #0 is connected to #1, #2, and #3 and #1 and #2 and #3 are linked with each other via some friendships). In fact, the subgraph on {#0, #1, #2, #3} forms a clique of size 4, meaning that in any valid coloring these four people must all wear different colors.

Since we only have four colors available (red, green, blue, yellow), each of these four must choose a unique color. Now, consider #4. #4 is friends with each of #0, #1, #2, and #3, so #4 sees all four colors already in use by his friends. Hence there is no color left for #4.

Thus, it is impossible for all eight people to wear shirts such that no two friends share the same color.
