We will show that no assignment of red, green, blue, and yellow shirts to the eight people can avoid at least one pair of friends wearing the same color.

One way to “encode” the problem is to view the eight people as vertices in a graph and add an edge between two vertices whenever those two people are friends. Then what we are being asked is: is the graph 4‐colorable, if the colors available are red, green, blue, and yellow?

Let us label the vertices as follows:
 • A = Alice
 • B = Bob
 • C = Carol
 • D = Dave
 • E = Ethan
 • F = Fran
 • G = George
 • H = Heather

The friendships (edges) are:
 • A is adjacent to C, D, F, G, H.
 • B is adjacent to C, D, E, F, G, H.
 • C is adjacent to A, B, F, H.
 • D is adjacent to A, B, E, G, H.
 • E is adjacent to B, D, F, G, H.
 • F is adjacent to A, B, C, E, G.
 • G is adjacent to A, B, D, E, F.
 • H is adjacent to A, B, C, D, E.

Notice that both A and B are “universal” in the sense that nearly every other vertex is adjacent to at least one of them. In particular, every vertex other than A and B is joined to at least one of A or B. Thus if we try “fixing” colors for A and B (say, red and green, respectively) then none of the other vertices C, D, E, F, G, and H may use red or green. This forces all of those six vertices to use one of only the remaining two colors (blue and yellow).

However, if you look closely at the subgraph induced by C, D, E, F, G, and H (together with the extra edges not involving A or B), you will find the following additional adjacencies:
 • C is joined to F and H.
 • D is joined to E, G, and H.
 • E is joined to F, G, and H.
 • F is joined to G.
 • (plus the symmetric edges to those listed)

A two‐coloring (using only blue and yellow) of a graph is equivalent to asking whether the graph is bipartite. One may check – by trying to assign, say, blue to C and then following through the edges (e.g. C–F forces F to yellow, C–H forces H to yellow, then D must be chosen, and so on) – that this induced subgraph is not bipartite. In every attempt one eventually finds a conflict.

Since the six vertices must be assigned colors from only two available choices but they interact in a way that makes a 2–coloring impossible, one sees that no proper assignment of four colors to the eight vertices exists.

Thus, it is impossible to choose shirt colors for Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, and Heather so that no pair of friends wears the same color.
