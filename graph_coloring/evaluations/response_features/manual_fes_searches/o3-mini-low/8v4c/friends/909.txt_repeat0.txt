We will show that no assignment of “red,” “green,” “blue,” and “yellow” to the eight people can avoid at least one pair of friends wearing the same color.

Below is one way of seeing that a proper color‐assignment is impossible.

Step 1. Represent the situation by a graph. Each person is a vertex and an edge connects two vertices if those people are friends. (For example, there is an edge between Alice and Dave because they are friends.)

Step 2. Write down the edges (friend relationships). For example, one finds that
  • Alice is adjacent to Dave, Ethan, Fran, and George.
  • Bob is adjacent to Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, and Heather.
  • Carol is adjacent to Dave, Fran, and George.
  • Dave is adjacent to Alice, Bob, Carol, Ethan, George, and Heather.
  • Ethan is adjacent to Alice, Bob, Dave, and Fran.
  • Fran is adjacent to Alice, Bob, Carol, Ethan, George, and Heather.
  • George is adjacent to Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Fran, and Heather.
  • Heather is adjacent to Bob, Dave, Fran, and George.

Step 3. Notice that Bob’s five friends (Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, and Heather) form an induced subgraph in which almost every pair is connected. In fact, aside from one missing edge (between Ethan and George) the five vertices are highly interconnected. (A little “pigeon‐hole” analysis shows that if five vertices are each colored by one of four colors then in order for one vertex to have an acceptable color the union of colors on its five neighbors must have fewer than four distinct colors. However, one may check that the five “neighbors” of Bob force all four colors to appear.)

Step 4. One may try various color assignments by starting from one vertex and propagating the restrictions along the edges. (For example, one may set
  Alice = Red,
  and then deduce for each friend of Alice that their color must be different from Red.
Continuing in this manner, one is forced eventually to assign Bob’s five neighbors four different colors. With all four colors “taken” Bob has no available color.)

Step 5. After several attempts at “back‐tracking” one finds that no assignment avoids a conflict on an edge somewhere in the graph.

Therefore, there is no valid way to choose for every person a shirt color from {red, green, blue, yellow} so that every pair of friends wears different colors.

The final answer is:

Impossible

Below is one way of seeing that a proper color‐assignment is impossible.

Step 1. Represent the situation by a graph. Each person is a vertex and an edge connects two vertices if those people are friends. (For example, there is an edge between #0 and #3 because they are friends.)

Step 2. Write down the edges (friend relationships). For example, one finds that
  • #0 is adjacent to #3, #4, #5, and #6.
  • #1 is adjacent to #3, #4, #5, #6, and #7.
  • #2 is adjacent to #3, #5, and #6.
  • #3 is adjacent to #0, #1, #2, #4, #6, and #7.
  • #4 is adjacent to #0, #1, #3, and #5.
  • #5 is adjacent to #0, #1, #2, #4, #6, and #7.
  • #6 is adjacent to #0, #1, #2, #3, #5, and #7.
  • #7 is adjacent to #1, #3, #5, and #6.

Step 3. Notice that #1’s five friends (#3, #4, #5, #6, and #7) form an induced subgraph in which almost every pair is connected. In fact, aside from one missing edge (between #4 and #6) the five vertices are highly interconnected. (A little “pigeon‐hole” analysis shows that if five vertices are each colored by one of four colors then in order for one vertex to have an acceptable color the union of colors on its five neighbors must have fewer than four distinct colors. However, one may check that the five “neighbors” of #1 force all four colors to appear.)

Step 4. One may try various color assignments by starting from one vertex and propagating the restrictions along the edges. (For example, one may set
  #0 = Red,
  and then deduce for each friend of #0 that their color must be different from Red.
Continuing in this manner, one is forced eventually to assign #1’s five neighbors four different colors. With all four colors “taken” #1 has no available color.)

Step 5. After several attempts at “back‐tracking” one finds that no assignment avoids a conflict on an edge somewhere in the graph.

Therefore, there is no valid way to choose for every person a shirt color from {red, green, blue, yellow} so that every pair of friends wears different colors.
