We will show that no choice of red, green, blue, and yellow for the eight people can avoid a conflict on every friendship. (Any “plan” you might try eventually runs into an impasse.) In fact, if we model the people as vertices and put an edge between two friends, the resulting graph requires at least 5 colors for a proper vertex‐coloring. (One way to see this is to check that there is a subgraph that “forces” four colors simultaneously on the neighbors of one vertex so that vertex itself cannot be colored by any of the four colors.) 

Hence, under the rule that any two people who are friends must wear different colored shirts, it is impossible to assign one of only the four colors (red, green, blue, yellow) to each person without conflict.
