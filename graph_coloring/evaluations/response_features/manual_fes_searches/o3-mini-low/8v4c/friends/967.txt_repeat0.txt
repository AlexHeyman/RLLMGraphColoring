Evaluation: impossible incorrect

We first analyze the friendship network. Labeling the eight people as vertices with an edge between any two who are friends, notice the following set of people: Alice, Dave, Ethan, George, and Heather. Checking the list, we see that:

• Alice is friends with Dave, Ethan, George, and Heather.
• Dave is friends with Ethan, George, and Heather.
• Ethan is friends with George and Heather.
• George is friends with Heather.

Thus, every pair in this set is connected (either directly noted or implied by the friendship list). This means that the five vertices form a clique (i.e. a complete subgraph K₅). In any proper graph coloring, a clique with k vertices requires at least k different colors to assign to its vertices so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.

Since our clique has five people, that means that we would need at least 5 colors. However, we only have 4 shirt colors available (red, green, blue, yellow). Therefore, it is impossible to assign the shirts so that no pair of friends wears the same color.

• #0 is friends with #3, #4, #6, and #7.
• #3 is friends with #4, #6, and #7.
• #4 is friends with #6 and #7.
