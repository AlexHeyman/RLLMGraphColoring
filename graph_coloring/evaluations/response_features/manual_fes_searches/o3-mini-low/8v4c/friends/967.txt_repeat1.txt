Notice that within the 8 people there is a clique (a set of people where every pair is friends). In particular, consider Bob, Dave, Ethan, George, and Heather. Checking the list:

• Bob is friends with Dave, Ethan, George, and Heather.
• Dave is friends with Bob, Ethan, George, and Heather.
• Ethan is friends with Bob, Dave, George, and Heather.
• George is friends with Bob, Dave, Ethan, and Heather.
• Heather is friends with Bob, Dave, Ethan, and George.

Since each pair in {Bob, Dave, Ethan, George, Heather} are friends, they form a clique of size 5. In any proper coloring of a graph, the size of the largest clique (the clique number) is a lower bound on the number of colors needed. Therefore, at least 5 different colors are required. Since we only have 4 available colors (red, green, blue, and yellow), it is impossible to assign a color to each person so that no two friends share the same color.

• #3 is friends with #1, #4, #6, and #7.
• #4 is friends with #1, #3, #6, and #7.
• #6 is friends with #1, #3, #4, and #7.
• #7 is friends with #1, #3, #4, and #6.
