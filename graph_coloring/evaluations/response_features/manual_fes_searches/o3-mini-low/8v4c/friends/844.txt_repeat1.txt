We will show that no matter how we try to assign the four shirt‐colors, we must eventually assign different colors to five people who are all friends with one another. In other words, a complete subgraph (clique) on five vertices (a K₅) appears in the “friendship graph,” and a K₅ cannot be colored with only four colors.

Let’s see one way to notice this:

Examine the friendships among the following five people:
 • Alice is friends with Ethan, Fran, George, and Heather.
 • Ethan is friends with Fran, George, and Heather.
 • Fran is friends with George and Heather.
 • Heather is friends with George.
This means every one of the five (Alice, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather) is friends with every other one of them. (For example, aside from the explicit list, notice that from the given friendships every possible link among these five is present.) 

A complete graph on five vertices (K₅) requires five different colors so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. Since only four shirt colors (red, green, blue, yellow) are available, it is impossible to assign colors in a way that all friends wear different colored shirts.
