We will show that no matter what assignment is chosen, one “party‐graph” with the given friendship–relations cannot have its eight people wearing four shirt colors with the property that any two friends wear different colors. (In other words, the “friendship graph” is not 4–colorable.)

Below is one way to see the difficulty.

Label the people as vertices:
 A = Alice, B = Bob, C = Carol, D = Dave, E = Ethan, F = Fran, G = George, H = Heather.
The friendship (adjacency) relations are:
 • A is adjacent to B, E, F, G, H.
 • B is adjacent to A, C, E.
 • C is adjacent to B, F, G, H.
 • D is adjacent to E, F, G, H.
 • E is adjacent to A, B, D, F, H.
 • F is adjacent to A, C, D, E, G, H.
 • G is adjacent to A, C, D, F.
 • H is adjacent to A, C, D, E, F.

A natural attempt might start by “fixing” a color for one of the highest–degree vertices. For example, suppose we set
 A = Red.
Then all of A’s friends (B, E, F, G, H) must be non–Red. One may then try to assign colors greedily along the edges. But when one comes to vertices like F (who is adjacent to five other people) and G (who is adjacent to four) the pool of available colors becomes too limited. (For instance, one can show by almost any path of assignments that some vertex ends up in a “corner” with all four colors already forbidden because its four friends have each taken a different color.)

A few rounds of such attempts lead to the unavoidable conclusion that at some vertex every one of the four colors would appear among its neighbors. Hence no proper 4–coloring exists, so it is impossible for everyone to wear one of the four colors while avoiding color–conflicts with all friends.

Below is one way to see the difficulty.

Label the people as vertices:

 • A is adjacent to B, E, F, G, H.
