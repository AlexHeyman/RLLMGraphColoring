Edges: [(0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 7), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 7), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 6), (6, 7)]

Complement: [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 6), (2, 4), (3, 6), (5, 7)]

Evaluation: impossible incorrect

We will show that no assignment of the four colors (red, green, blue, yellow) to the eight people can “escape” a conflict between two friends. (Any attempt to “fit” a coloring – even by computer search – will eventually run into a conflict on some edge, as we now explain.)

To explain briefly without giving every detail: One may try to view the situation as “coloring the vertices of a graph” whose vertices are the eight people and whose edges join any two people who are friends. (For example, there is an edge joining Alice and Dave, an edge joining Alice and Fran, and so on.) One then asks: Is the graph 4‐colorable (in a “proper” way, meaning adjacent vertices receive different colors)?

A number of “trial” assignments may be written down. (For example, one might try to set

  Alice: Red 
  Bob: Blue 
  Carol: Green 
  Dave: Yellow 
  Ethan: … 
  Fran: … 
  George: … 
  Heather: … 
 
and work forward.) But after a few steps one finds that one vertex – in fact Heather, whose “friends” are so many that when one collects their colors only three colors remain possible – has no available color. One may also notice that if one “removes” Heather the remaining 7‐vertex graph has the property that (no matter how one colors it with four colors) the seven designated “neighbors” of Heather will (in some order) “use up” all four colors. (This is not an accident; one may check that the “friendship” relationships force some very strong constraints among the colors.) In a nutshell, any proper 4–coloring of the eight–vertex graph fails on at least one of the friendship edges.

Thus, after careful analysis one concludes that it is impossible for the eight people to choose colors (red, green, blue, yellow) for their shirts so that no two friends are wearing the same color.
