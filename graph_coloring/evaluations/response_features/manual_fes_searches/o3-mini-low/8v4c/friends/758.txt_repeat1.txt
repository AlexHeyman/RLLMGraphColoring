The key is to look at the subgraph formed by Carol, Ethan, Fran, George, and Heather. (A subgraph is simply a selection of some of the people and all the friendships among them.) Notice that according to the friendship list:

• Carol is friends with Ethan, Fran, and George.
• Ethan is friends with Carol, Fran, and George (as well as Heather).
• Fran is friends with Carol, Ethan, and George.
• George is friends with Carol, Ethan, and Fran.
• Heather is friends with Carol, Ethan, Fran, and George.

This means that among Carol, Ethan, Fran, and George every pair of people are friends with each other. That is, these four people form a complete subgraph (a clique) on 4 vertices. Moreover, Heather is friends with each person in that clique. Thus, the set {Carol, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather} forms a complete graph on 5 vertices (a K₅).

Since every pair of vertices in a complete graph must have different colors in a proper coloring, a K₅ requires 5 different colors. However, we are only allowed 4 shirt colors (red, green, blue, yellow).

Because of this K₅ within the friendship graph, there’s no way to assign 4 colors to the 8 people without giving two friends the same color.

The key is to look at the subgraph formed by #2, #4, #5, #6, and #7. (A subgraph is simply a selection of some of the people and all the friendships among them.) Notice that according to the friendship list:

• #2 is friends with #4, #5, and #6.
• #4 is friends with #2, #5, and #6 (as well as #7).
• #5 is friends with #2, #4, and #6.
• #6 is friends with #2, #4, and #5.
• #7 is friends with #2, #4, #5, and #6.

This means that among #2, #4, #5, and #6 every pair of people are friends with each other. That is, these four people form a complete subgraph (a clique) on 4 vertices. Moreover, #7 is friends with each person in that clique. Thus, the set {#2, #4, #5, #6, #7} forms a complete graph on 5 vertices (a K₅).
