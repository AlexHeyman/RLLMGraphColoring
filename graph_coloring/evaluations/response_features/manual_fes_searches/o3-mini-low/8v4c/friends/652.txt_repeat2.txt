Let's first list the friendships between the 8 people:

• Alice is friends with Bob, Carol, Dave, and Ethan.
• Bob is friends with Alice, Ethan, and Fran.
• Carol is friends with Alice, Dave, Ethan, and Fran.
• Dave is friends with Alice, Carol, Ethan, Fran, George, and Heather.
• Ethan is friends with Alice, Bob, Carol, and Dave.
• Fran is friends with Bob, Carol, and Dave.
• George is friends with Dave and Heather.
• Heather is friends with Dave and George.

Now notice that Ethan is friends with Alice, Bob, Carol, and Dave. This means Ethan is adjacent to four different people. In a proper graph coloring using only four colors (red, green, blue, yellow), each vertex (person) must have a color different from all its adjacent vertices. 

Consider the vertex corresponding to Ethan. Ethan’s four neighbors are Alice, Bob, Carol, and Dave. In any 4-color assignment, if all four are colored with the four available colors, then there is no color left for Ethan. 

For instance, one possible assignment (if we try) might be:
 Alice: Red
 Bob: Green
 Carol: Blue
 Dave: Yellow
Then Ethan, who is friends with all of these, has no available color from the set {Red, Green, Blue, Yellow}.

Since this conflict cannot be resolved with only four colors, it is impossible to assign shirt colors to all 8 people while ensuring that no one wears the same color as any of their friends.

Let's first list the friendships between the 8 people:

• #0 is friends with #1, #2, #3, and #4.
• #1 is friends with #0, #4, and #5.
• #2 is friends with #0, #3, #4, and #5.
• #3 is friends with #0, #2, #4, #5, #6, and #7.
• #4 is friends with #0, #1, #2, and #3.
• #5 is friends with #1, #2, and #3.
• #6 is friends with #3 and #7.
• #7 is friends with #3 and #6.

Now notice that #4 is friends with #0, #1, #2, and #3. This means #4 is adjacent to four different people. In a proper graph coloring using only four colors (red, green, blue, yellow), each vertex (person) must have a color different from all its adjacent vertices. 

Consider the vertex corresponding to #4. #4’s four neighbors are #0, #1, #2, and #3. In any 4-color assignment, if all four are colored with the four available colors, then there is no color left for #4. 

For instance, one possible assignment (if we try) might be:
 #0: Red
 #1: Green
 #2: Blue
 #3: Yellow
Then #4, who is friends with all of these, has no available color from the set {Red, Green, Blue, Yellow}.

Since this conflict cannot be resolved with only four colors, it is impossible to assign shirt colors to all 8 people while ensuring that no one wears the same color as any of their friends.
