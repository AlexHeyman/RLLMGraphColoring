So vertex 10 is connected to 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. That's 10 neighbors! Vertices are 0 to 11, so 12 vertices, vertex 10 is connected to all except itself and 11. Neighbors are 0-9, that's 10 vertices, yes degree 10.

So every vertex except 7 is adjacent to 1, and 7 is adjacent to 2, both red, so no vertex can be colored red without conflicting, but we already have 1 and 2 red, and they are not adjacent, so it's ok, but for other vertices, they are all adjacent to at least one of 1 or 2, so they cannot be red, which is fine, since we have other colors.
