Line 31
For any valid coloring, all vertices in a clique must have distinct colors. Since {A, B, D, F, G} form a K_5 clique, these 5 people must all wear different colored shirts. This means we need at least 5 distinct colors for a valid assignment.

Line 23
Since every pair of vertices in the set {D, E, F, G, H} is connected by an edge, this set forms a K5 clique (a complete subgraph with 5 vertices). In any valid coloring of the graph, all vertices in a clique must have distinct colors. Therefore, we need at least 5 different colors to color the vertices D, E, F, G, and H.
