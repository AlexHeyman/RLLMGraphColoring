- Vertex 6: Connected to 0,1,2,4,5,7 (from edges: (0,6), (1,6), (2,6), (4,6), (5,6), and (6,7)? Wait, is (6,7) there? Looking back: no direct (6,7), but (0,7),(1,7),(2,7),(3,7),(4,7),(5,7) are there, so 7 is connected to 0-5, but not explicitly to 6. Wait, edges list: (5,7) is there, but not (6,7). Let me double-check the list.

False edges:
(6, 7) [Manual assessment: N/A]

- Vertex 6: connected to 2, 3, 4, 7  (from the edges: (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), and (3,7) wait no, (6,7) is not listed, wait is it? Edges: (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), and (3,7), (2,7), etc. Wait, (6,7) is not in the list. So vertex 6: 2,3,4, and is there more? Only those.

Now, vertex 1 is connected to 0, so it can't be Red. Let's make it Green.

False edges:
(0, 1) [Manual assessment: N/A]
