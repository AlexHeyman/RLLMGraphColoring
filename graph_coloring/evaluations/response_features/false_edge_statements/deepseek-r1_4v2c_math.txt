So the edges are between 0 and 3, and between 1 and 2. That means vertex 0 is connected to 3, and vertex 1 is connected to 2. The other vertices (like 0 connected to 1 or 2, etc.) aren't mentioned, so they aren't directly linked. So the graph is split into two separate edges, right? Like two disconnected pairs. Because 0-3 is one pair and 1-2 is another. There's no connection between these two pairs.

False edges:

Vertex 0 is connected to 1 and 3. Vertex 1 is connected to 0 and 2. Vertex 2 is connected to 1. Vertex 3 is connected to 0. Vertex 2 and 3 aren't connected to each other. Hmm, so this graph might be a tree or have a cycle. Wait, let me check for cycles. Starting from 0: 0-1-2, but 2 isn't connected back to 0. 0-1-0 is a cycle of length 2? No, because edges are undirected but you can't have a cycle with two edges. Wait, maybe the graph is a chain like 0-1-2, and 0-3. So the structure is 0 connected to 1 and 3, and 1 connected to 2. So there's a triangle? No, because 0-1-2-0 would require 2 connected to 0, which it's not. So there's no cycle here. Therefore, the graph is a tree. Since trees are bipartite, which means they can be colored with two colors. So it should be possible.

Vertex 0 is connected to both 2 and 3. Vertex 1 is connected only to 2. Vertex 2 is connected to 0, 1, and 3. Vertex 3 is connected only to 0. So, vertex 2 is the one with the most connections, right? Let me list the adjacency list:

- 2 is connected to 0, 1, and 3. Wait, no, 2 is connected to 0, 1, and 3? Wait, edges are (0,2), (0,3), (1,2). So vertex 2 is connected to 0, 1, and 3. Vertex 3 is connected to 0 and 2. Vertex 0 is connected to 2 and 3. Vertex 1 is only connected to 2. So vertex 2 is the most connected one with three edges. Hmm, that's important because in graph coloring, a vertex with high degree can sometimes complicate things.
