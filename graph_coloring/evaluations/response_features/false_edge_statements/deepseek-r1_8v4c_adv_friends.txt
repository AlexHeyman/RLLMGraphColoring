Another group: Dave's friends include Bob, Carol, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather. Check if any four of these form a clique. Carol and Ethan? No. Carol and Fran? Yes. Carol and George? Yes. But Ethan and George? Yes. Wait, Carol is friends with Dave, Fran, George. Fran is friends with Carol, Dave, etc. But does Carol, Fran, George, Dave form a clique? Dave is friends with Carol, Fran, George. Carol is friends with Fran and George. Fran is friends with Carol and George. George is friends with Carol and Fran. So that's a K4: Carol, Fran, George, Dave. Wait, are they all connected? Let me check:

Now, Bob is friends with Carol (red), Dave (blue), George (yellow), and Fran (green). So Bob can't be red, blue, green, yellow. But we only have four colors. Wait, that's impossible. So Bob is friends with all four of them, so he can't wear any color. But that's a problem. Because Bob is part of the larger graph. So this approach doesn't work.

Wait, this is a complex subgraph. Let's see if this subgraph is 3-colorable. Let's try to color these six nodes with three colors. Let's pick Carol first. Suppose Carol is Green. Then Ethan, George, Heather can't be Green. Let's assign Ethan to Blue. Then George can't be Green or Blue (since Carol and Ethan are connected to George), so George is Yellow. Heather is connected to Carol and George, so Heather can't be Green or Yellow; Heather could be Blue. Now, check Heather's connections: Heather is friends with Dave. If Heather is Blue, then Dave can't be Blue. Also, Dave is friends with Fran, George, Heather. George is Yellow, Heather is Blue, so Dave can be Green. Then Fran is friends with Dave (Green), Ethan (Blue), George (Yellow), so Fran can't be Green, Blue, or Yellow. But we only have three colors here. So Fran would need a fourth color, which isn't allowed. Therefore, this attempt fails.

Alternatively, maybe assign Heather a different color. Let's try again. Carol is Green. Ethan is Blue. George is Yellow. Heather can't be Green or Yellow (from Carol and George), so Heather is Blue. But Heather is friends with Ethan (Blue), which is a conflict. So Heather can't be Blue. Therefore, Heather can't be Green, Blue, or Yellow. So that's a problem. So this coloring doesn't work.

But Ethan is friends with Fran (green). Oh, no! Fran is green, and Ethan is friends with Fran? Wait, let me check Ethan's friends again. Ethan's friends are Alice, Carol, Dave, George, Heather. So Ethan is not friends with Fran. Therefore, Ethan can be green even if Fran is green. So no conflict there. Wait, Fran and Ethan are not friends. So Ethan can be green. So that's okay.

George is friends with Heather. So that's a complete subgraph of 4 nodes (Carol, Ethan, George, Heather), right? Because each of those four is connected to every other. So that's a 4-clique. Therefore, since we need 4 colors for that clique, and the rest of the graph can be colored with the same 4 colors if possible. But since the problem allows 4 colors, maybe it's possible.

Let me see if there's a K5 here. A complete graph with five nodes where each is connected to every other. Let's check. For example, Alice is connected to Bob, Carol, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather. So Alice's friends include six people. If any five of them form a complete subgraph, that would be K5. Let's see: Are Bob, Carol, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather all connected to each other? Let's check Bob's connections to Carol (yes), Ethan? Bob isn't friends with Ethan according to the original list. Wait, original list: Bob is friends with Alice, Carol, Fran, George, Heather. So Bob is not friends with Ethan or Dave. So among Alice's friends (Bob, Carol, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather), Bob is not friends with Ethan. So that breaks the K5 possibility. Similarly, Carol's friends include Dave, but Dave isn't friends with Alice. So maybe there's a K3,3. Let's see. K3,3 is a bipartite graph with two sets of three nodes each, all nodes in one set connected to all nodes in the other. For example, suppose we have set A: Alice, Carol, George; set B: Bob, Fran, Heather. Are all in set A connected to all in set B? Alice is connected to Bob, Fran, Heather. Carol is connected to Bob, but not sure about Fran. Carol's friends: Alice, Bob, Dave, Ethan, George, Heather. So Carol is not friends with Fran. So set A (Alice, Carol, George) to set B (Bob, Fran, Heather) would have Alice connected to all in B, Carol connected only to Bob and Heather (since Carol isn't friends with Fran), and George is friends with Bob, Fran, Heather. So George is connected to Bob, Fran, Heather. So set A: Alice (connected to B: Bob, Fran, Heather), Carol (connected to Bob, Heather), George (connected to Bob, Fran, Heather). So not all nodes in A connected to all in B. So that's not a K3,3.

Alice is friends with Bob and Ethan, but Carol is friends with Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather. So Carol is friends with Ethan, but is Carol friends with Alice? The original list says Carol is friends with Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather. So Carol isn't friends with Alice. So Alice and Carol aren't friends. So that group can't be a 4-clique. Let's check another group. How about Dave, Ethan, Fran, George. Dave is friends with Ethan, Fran, George. Ethan is friends with Fran, George. Fran is friends with George. George is friends with Dave, Ethan, Fran. So Dave, Ethan, Fran, George: each is friends with the others. So that's a 4-clique. Because Dave is friends with Ethan, Fran, George. Ethan is friends with Fran and George. Fran is friends with George. So each pair in that group is connected. So that's a 4-clique. So that means this subgraph requires four colors.

Wait, but in the subgraph excluding Fran, Heather is friends with Alice, Bob, Dave, Ethan, George. So Heather and Carol are not friends. So Heather can be blue. So assign Heather blue. Then George's friends: Alice (green), Bob (green), Ethan, Heather (blue). George can't be green or blue. So George can be yellow. Then Ethan's friends: Bob (green), Carol (blue), George (yellow), Heather (blue). So Ethan can't be green, blue, or yellow. Wait, that leaves no color for Ethan. Because the colors are red, green, blue, yellow. But red is already used by Fran. Wait, no. Wait, in the subgraph excluding Fran, the colors allowed are green, blue, yellow, because Fran is red. Wait, no, Fran is red, so the others can't use red. So the available colors for the subgraph are green, blue, yellow. So Ethan can't be green (Bob), blue (Carol, Heather), or yellow (George).

Check for K3,3. A bipartition of 3 and 3 nodes with all edges between partitions. For example, maybe Bob, Carol, Ethan and Dave, Fran, George. Let's see if each of the first group is connected to each of the second. Bob is friends with Dave (yes), Fran (no), George (yes). Carol is friends with Dave (yes), Fran (yes), George (yes). Ethan is friends with Dave (no), Fran (yes), George (yes). So this doesn't form a K3,3. Maybe another combination. It's getting complicated. Maybe the graph is planar. If it's planar, then four colors suffice. If not, maybe more. But without a clear K5 or K3,3, it's hard to say. Maybe it's planar. Let's assume it's planar and proceed.

Bob is connected to Alice, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George. So Bob is friends with Dave, Ethan, Fran. Carol is friends with Alice, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather. So in George's friends, maybe a clique of 4? Let's see: Take Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave. Are they all connected? Alice is friends with Bob, Carol, Dave. Bob is friends with Alice, Dave, but not Carol. So Bob and Carol aren't friends. So that's not a clique. How about Dave, Ethan, Fran, George? Dave is friends with Ethan, Fran, George. Ethan is friends with Dave, Fran, George.

Wait, but let's check. For example, look at Bob, Carol, Dave. Bob is friends with Carol and Dave. Carol is friends with Dave. So Bob, Carol, Dave form a triangle (clique of size 3). Similarly, Dave is friends with George and Heather. Let's see if any 4 people form a clique. Let's check Bob, Dave, George, Heather. Are all connected? Bob is friends with Dave, George, Heather. Dave is friends with George and Heather. George is friends with Heather? Let's check: George is friends with Bob, Dave, Ethan, Fran, Heather. So George and Heather are friends. Heather is friends with Bob, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George. So yes, Bob, Dave, George, Heather: each pair is friends. That's a clique of size 4. Wait, but Bob is friends with Dave, George, Heather. Dave is friends with George and Heather. George is friends with Heather. So all four are connected. So that's a 4-clique. Therefore, this subgraph (Bob, Dave, George, Heather) requires 4 different colors. But wait, in the subgraph after removing Alice, which is supposed to be colored with 3 colors (Green, Blue, Yellow), but there's a 4-clique here. That would require 4 colors, which we don't have. Therefore, it's impossible to color the entire graph with 4 colors because this clique alone needs 4 colors, and since Alice is already using one color (Red), the remaining 4 in the clique would need 4 distinct colors, but we only have 3 available (Green, Blue, Yellow). Therefore, the problem is impossible.

Wait, no: the original list says "Carol is friends with Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather" but doesn't mention Alice. Wait, no! Wait, the first line says "Alice is friends with Carol", but does it say that Carol is friends with Alice? In an undirected graph, friendships are mutual. So if Alice is friends with Carol, then Carol is friends with Alice. So the original list should be read as undirected edges. Therefore, when it says "Alice is friends with Carol", that's a mutual friendship. So Carol's friends include Alice, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather. So Carol has 6 friends. Similarly, Dave's friends: Alice, Bob, Carol, Ethan, George, Heather. Because Alice is friends with Dave, Bob is friends with Dave, Carol is friends with Dave, and then Dave's own list adds Ethan, George, Heather. Wait, but according to the original list, Dave's friends are Ethan, George, Heather. But since Alice, Bob, Carol are friends with Dave, that's mutual.

Similarly, Ethan's friends: Alice (since Alice is friends with Ethan), Bob (Bob is friends with Ethan), Carol (Carol is friends with Ethan), Dave (Dave is friends with Ethan), and Fran (Ethan is friends with Fran).

Wait, Carol is friends with George, but also Fran is friends with George and Heather. Wait, according to the original list, Fran is friends with George and Heather.

George is friends with Bob, Dave, Heather. Heather is friends with Bob, Dave, George. So among these five (Alice, Bob, Dave, George, Heather), each is connected to the others except that Alice is not friends with anyone else except as per the list. Wait, but Alice is friends with all of them, but Bob, Dave, George, Heather form a K4 among themselves. Because Bob is friends with Dave, George, Heather. Dave is friends with George and Heather. George is friends with Heather. So that's a complete K4. But K4 is planar and can be colored with four colors. So that's okay. But if there's a K5, then we need five colors. Let me check another group. Let's see, Dave is friends with Alice, Bob, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather. So Dave is connected to six people. Let's check if any five of his friends form a K5. His friends are Alice, Bob, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather. For example, Alice, Bob, Ethan, George, Heather. Alice is friends with all except maybe some. But Bob isn't friends with Ethan? Wait, according to the original list, Bob's friends are Alice, Dave, George, Heather. So Bob is not friends with Ethan. So in the group Alice, Bob, Ethan, George, Heather: Alice is friends with all except Bob is not friends with Ethan, so that's not a K5. Similarly, another group: Ethan's friends are Alice, Carol, Dave, Fran, George, Heather. Let's see if any five of those form a K5. Alice is friends with Carol, Dave, Ethan, George, Heather. Carol is friends with Alice, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather. Dave is friends with Alice, Bob, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather. Fran is friends with Carol, Dave, Ethan. George is friends with Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Heather. Heather is friends with Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, George. Let's take Alice, Carol, Dave, George, Heather. Alice is friends with all except maybe some. Carol is friends with Alice, Dave, George, Heather. Dave is friends with Alice, Carol, George, Heather. George is friends with Alice, Carol, Dave, Heather. Heather is friends with Alice, Carol, Dave, George. So in this group, each person is connected to all others except maybe Alice's connections. Wait, Alice is friends with all of them. So Alice is connected to Carol, Dave, George, Heather. Carol is connected to Dave, George, Heather. Dave is connected to George, Heather. George is connected to Heather. So this group (Alice, Carol, Dave, George, Heather) forms a K5? Let me see. Alice is connected to Carol, Dave, George, Heather. Carol is connected to Alice, Dave, George, Heather. Dave is connected to Alice, Carol, George, Heather. George is connected to Alice, Carol, Dave, Heather. Heather is connected to Alice, Carol, Dave, George. So each of the five is connected to the other four. So that's a complete graph K5. Therefore, this subset forms a K5. Therefore, the graph contains a K5 subgraph. But K5 is non-planar and requires five colors. However, the problem allows four colors. Therefore, this would be impossible. Wait, but wait, the four-color theorem says that planar graphs can be colored with four colors. But since this graph contains a K5, which is non-planar, but the four-color theorem doesn't apply here. However, the problem is not about planar graphs; it's just about graph coloring. So if there's a K5 subgraph, then the chromatic number is at least 5. Therefore, since we only have four colors, it's impossible. Therefore, the answer should be "Impossible".

Dave is friends with Alice (yes), Carol (no, because Dave's friends are Alice, Bob, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather). Wait, Dave is friends with Carol? No, as per earlier analysis. So Dave is not friends with Carol. So adding Dave to the clique of Alice, Carol, Ethan, Fran would not work. Similarly, George: George is friends with Alice, Carol, Ethan, Fran. So George is friends with all four. Let's see: George is friends with Alice, Carol, Ethan, Fran. But in the clique of Alice, Carol, Ethan, Fran, George, we need each pair to be friends. For example, George is friends with all four, but do all four also be friends with George? Yes.

Take Alice, Bob, Dave, Fran. Are they all connected? Alice is connected to Bob, Dave, Fran. Bob is connected to Dave and Fran. Dave is connected to Bob and Fran. Fran is connected to Alice, Bob, Dave. So yes, Alice, Bob, Dave, Fran form a clique of size 4. Each is connected to the others. Because Alice is friends with Bob, Dave, Fran. Bob is friends with Alice, Dave, Fran. Dave is friends with Alice, Bob, Fran. Fran is friends with Alice, Bob, Dave. So that's a complete subgraph (clique) of 4. Therefore, in the subgraph excluding George, there is a clique of size 4. Therefore, to color this clique, you need 4 colors. But since these four nodes are in the subgraph that cannot use George's color (Red, say), they must be colored with Green, Blue, Yellow. But a clique of 4 requires 4 colors, which we don't have (only 3 available). Therefore, it's impossible to color this subgraph with three colors. Hence, the entire graph cannot be colored with four colors. Therefore, the answer is Impossible.

Wait, the graph's maximum degree is 6, but according to graph coloring, the chromatic number could be higher than the maximum degree in some cases, but there's a theorem that says that a graph is (Δ+1)-colorable, where Δ is the maximum degree.

So let's list Carol's friends. According to the problem: Carol is friends with Alice, Bob, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather. So yes, that's seven people. So Carol is connected to everyone except maybe no one. Wait, Carol is friends with all others. So that's seven friends. So when we need to assign colors, Carol's color must be different from all seven friends. But each of those seven friends must have different colors from Carol and from each other. But since there are only four colors, this is impossible because even if we use all four colors for the friends, since there are seven friends, they can't all have distinct colors. Wait, but maybe some of the friends are friends with each other, so their colors can overlap. Wait, but Carol's friends are all connected to Carol, but they might not be connected to each other. Wait, but in this case, let's check if Carol's friends are all connected to each other. For example, Alice is friends with Bob, Carol, Dave, George, Heather. So Alice is friends with Bob, Carol, Dave, George, Heather. But Bob is friends with Carol, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather. So Bob is friends with Alice, Carol, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather. So Alice and Bob are friends. So in the graph, Carol's friends include Alice and Bob, who are friends with each other. Similarly, Dave is friends with Carol and Alice, and also with Ethan, Fran, George, Heather. So Dave is friends with several others. So the friends of Carol form a subgraph where many of them are connected. Therefore, the graph is highly connected. So the maximum clique size might be larger than four. Wait, a clique is a set of people all connected to each other. If there's a clique of size five, then you need five colors. Let's see. Let's check if there is a clique of five people. For example, Carol is friends with Alice, Bob, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather. But are any five of them all friends with each other? Let's see. Take Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, George. Are they all friends with each other? Alice is friends with Bob, Carol, Dave, George, Heather. Bob is friends with Alice, Carol, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather. Carol is friends with everyone.

Since Alice is Red, which Dave can't use because he's friends with Alice. Wait, no, Dave is friends with Alice, so he can't be Red. So Dave's available colors are Green, Blue, Yellow. But he can't be any of them because of his friends. So this approach fails.

So, each person is connected to many others. Let's see if this graph is 4-colorable. Since the maximum degree here is 7 (for George and Heather), but we have 4 colors. Wait, there's a theorem that says that a graph is k-colorable if its chromatic number is at most k. But the chromatic number isn't directly determined by the maximum degree. For example, a graph with maximum degree Δ can sometimes require Δ+1 colors. However, according to Brooks' theorem, any connected undirected graph not complete graph or an odd cycle has chromatic number at most Δ. But in this case, George and Heather have degree 7, which is the maximum. Let's check if the graph is a complete graph. Since there are 8 people, a complete graph would have each node connected to 7 others. But here, George and Heather are each connected to 7 others, but let's see: for example, is George friends with everyone except someone? Let's check George's friends. George is friends with Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, Heather. So yes, George is friends with all except maybe someone? Wait, the list says Alice is friends with George, Bob is friends with George, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, Heather. So George is friends with everyone except... wait, the original list says George is friends with Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, and Heather. So George is friends with all 7 others. Similarly, Heather is friends with Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George. So Heather is also friends with everyone. Wait, so both George and Heather are connected to all other 7 people. So the graph contains two nodes (George and Heather) that are connected to everyone else. But are George and Heather friends with each other? Let me check. The original list says Heather is friends with George, yes. So George and Heather are friends. Therefore, the graph has George and Heather each connected to all others, including each other. So, in that case, the graph is not a complete graph of 8 nodes (since in a complete graph of 8 nodes, every node is connected to every other node). But here, let's check if there are any pairs that are not friends. For example, is Bob friends with Ethan? Let me check the original list. Bob's friends: Carol, Dave, Fran, George, Heather. So Bob is not friends with Ethan. Similarly, let's check Alice's friends. She's friends with Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather. So Alice is not friends with Bob. Wait, that's a key point. So Alice and Bob are not friends. Similarly, let's check other pairs. For example, Carol and Ethan: Carol's friends are Alice, Bob, Dave, Fran, George, Heather. So Carol is not friends with Ethan. Dave's friends: Alice, Bob, Carol, Ethan, George, Heather. So Dave is friends with Ethan. Ethan's friends: Alice, Dave, Fran, George, Heather. So Ethan is not friends with Bob or Carol. Fran's friends: Alice, Bob, Carol, Ethan, George, Heather. So Fran is friends with everyone except Dave? Wait, no, Dave's friends include Fran? Let me check. Dave's friends are Alice, Bob, Carol, Ethan, George, Heather. So Dave is not friends with Fran? Wait, according to the original list: Dave is friends with Ethan, George, Heather. Wait, let me recheck all the friendships step by step.

Dave's friends: Bob, Carol, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather. So Dave is friends with Ethan, Fran, George, Heather. Ethan's friends include Dave, Fran, George, Heather. Fran's friends include Dave, Ethan, George, Heather. George's friends include Dave, Ethan, Fran. Heather's friends include Dave, Ethan, Fran. So in Bob's friends (excluding Alice), the group Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather: George is not friends with Heather. Because George's friends are Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran. Heather is friends with Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran. So Heather and George are not friends. So in Bob's friends, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather: George and Heather are not friends. So the maximum clique among Bob's friends would be maybe Dave, Ethan, Fran, Heather. Let's see if they form a clique. Dave is friends with Ethan, Fran, Heather. Ethan is friends with Dave, Fran, Heather. Fran is friends with Dave, Ethan, Heather. Heather is friends with Dave, Ethan, Fran. So Dave, Ethan, Fran, Heather are all friends with each other. So that's a clique of size 4. So a 4-clique. Then Bob is connected to all of them. So Bob plus this clique would make a 5-clique? Wait, but Bob is friends with all of them (Dave, Ethan, Fran, Heather), so if they form a 4-clique, then Bob is connected to each of them, making a 5-clique? Wait, but Bob is part of the group. Wait, if Bob is friends with Dave, Ethan, Fran, Heather, and those four are all friends with each other, then Bob, Dave, Ethan, Fran, Heather would form a 5-clique? But wait, Heather is friends with Bob, Dave, Ethan, Fran. But is Heather friends with George? No. So in this case, the 4-clique is Dave, Ethan, Fran, Heather. Adding Bob, he is friends with all of them. So Bob is part of a 5-clique? Because Bob is connected to Dave, Ethan, Fran, Heather, and they are all connected to each other. So yes, that would form a 5-clique. If that's the case, then the graph has a 5-clique. But if the graph has a 5-clique, then the chromatic number is at least 5, but we only have 4 colors. Therefore, it's impossible.

But Ethan is friends with Dave (Yellow) and Fran (Red), Alice (Green). So Blue is okay. Now, Ethan is friends with Heather. So Heather can't be Blue. Heather's friends include Alice (Green), Bob (Blue), Dave (Yellow), Fran (Red), George, Ethan (Blue). So Heather can't be Green, Blue, Red, or Yellow. Wait, that's all four colors. That's a problem. Wait, Heather's friends are Alice (Green), Bob (Blue), Dave (Yellow), Fran (Red), George, Ethan (Blue). So Heather's friends are using Green, Blue, Yellow, Red. So Heather can't wear any color. That's impossible. So this path leads to a contradiction.

Let me start by listing all the friendships. Alice is friends with Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather. That's almost everyone except herself. Wait, Alice is friends with 7 people? So Alice is connected to everyone else. That means in the graph, Alice is a central node connected to all other 7. Then Bob is friends with Carol, Dave, George, Heather. Carol is friends with Bob, Ethan, Fran, George, Heather. Dave is friends with Bob, Ethan, Fran, Heather. Ethan is friends with Alice, Carol, Dave, George. Fran is friends with Alice, Carol, Dave, George. George is friends with Alice, Bob, Carol, Ethan, Fran, Heather. Heather is friends with Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, George.

- Heather's friends: Let's see who lists Heather. Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George. So Heather is friends with everyone except maybe Fran? Wait, Fran is friends with Heather. So Heather is friends with Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ethan, Fran, George. So Heather has seven friends. That's a lot.

So this is a complex subgraph. Let's see if it's 3-colorable. Let's try to color it with three colors. Let's pick a starting point, say Alice. Let's assign Alice to red. Then her friends (Dave, Fran, Heather) can't be red. So Dave, Fran, Heather must be green, blue, or yellow. Let's assign Dave to green. Then, Dave's friends (Alice, Bob, Ethan, George, Heather) can't be green. But Alice is red, so Bob, Ethan, George, Heather can't be green if they are friends with Dave. Wait, Dave is friends with Bob, Ethan, George, Heather. So Bob, Ethan, George, Heather can't be green. So Bob's color can't be green. Let's assign Bob to blue. Bob's friends are Dave (green), Fran, George, Heather. So Fran, George, Heather can't be blue. Fran is friends with Alice (red) and Bob (blue), so Fran can't be red or blue. So Fran must be green or yellow. But Fran is friends with Dave (green), so Fran can't be green. Therefore, Fran must be yellow. Now, Fran is yellow. Fran's friends are Alice (red), Bob (blue), Ethan, George, Heather. So Ethan, George, Heather can't be yellow. Let's see Ethan's friends are Dave (green) and Fran (yellow). So Ethan can't be green or yellow. So Ethan can be red or blue. But Ethan isn't friends with Alice (red), so red is possible. Assign Ethan to red. Now, George is friends with Bob (blue), Dave (green), Fran (yellow), and Heather. So George can't be blue, green, or yellow. So George must be red. But George is friends with Heather, who is connected to Alice (red), Bob (blue), Dave (green), Fran (yellow). Heather can't be red, blue, green, or yellow? Wait, no. Wait, Heather's friends are Alice (red), Bob (blue), Dave (green), Fran (yellow), George. So Heather can't be any of those colors. But we only have four colors. Wait, this is a problem. Because Heather's friends are using red, blue, green, yellow. So Heather can't wear any color. That's impossible. So this path leads to a contradiction.

Order the people in decreasing order of degrees: Fran, George (both 6), Alice, Carol, Dave, Heather (5), Bob, Ethan (4). Let's start with Fran. Assign Fran red. Then move to George. He can't be red. Assign green. Next Alice: she's friends with Fran (red) and George (green). So she can be blue or yellow. Let's pick blue. Then Carol: friends with Fran (red) and George (green). So Carol can be blue or yellow. Let's assign her yellow. Then Dave: friends with Fran (red), George (green), Alice (blue), and Carol (yellow). Wait, Dave's friends are Alice, Bob, Carol, George, Heather. So Dave is connected to Alice (blue), Bob, Carol (yellow), George (green), Heather. So Dave cannot be blue, yellow, green, or red (if any of those are used by friends). Wait, but Fran is red, George is green, Alice is blue, Carol is yellow. So Dave's friends include Alice (blue), Carol (yellow), George (green), and Fran (red). So all four colors are used by his friends. Therefore, Dave cannot wear any color. That's a problem. So this approach leads to a conflict. Therefore, the initial color assignment might not work.
