Line 5
Let's examine the given graph for cliques. The vertices are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}.

False edges:
(0, 5) [Manual assessment: false positive]
(1, 2) [Manual assessment: false positive]
(2, 5) [Manual assessment: false positive]
(3, 4) [Manual assessment: false positive]
(3, 5) [Manual assessment: false positive]
(4, 5) [Manual assessment: false positive]

Line 65
Therefore, the subset of vertices {0, 1, 3, 6, 7} forms a K5 (a clique of size 5).

False edges:
(6, 7) [Manual assessment: true positive]

Line 21
All pairs of vertices within the set {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} are connected by an edge. This means that the subgraph induced by these 5 vertices forms a K5 clique.

False edges:
(2, 4) [Manual assessment: true positive]

Line 18
Since all 10 possible edges between the 5 vertices {3, 4, 5, 6, 7} exist, these vertices form a 5-clique (K5).

False edges:
(3, 6) [Manual assessment: true positive]
