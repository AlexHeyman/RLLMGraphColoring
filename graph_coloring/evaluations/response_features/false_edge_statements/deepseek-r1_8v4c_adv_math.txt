Hmm. Let me try to visualize this graph. Maybe vertex 0 is connected to 1,4,5,6,7. So vertex 0 has degree 5. Vertex 1 is connected to 0,2,3,4,6,7. So degree 6. Vertex 2 is connected to 1,3,5,6,7.

So no, vertex 1 is not connected to 5. So vertices 1,2,5,6: 1 connected to 2 and 6; 2 connected to 5 and 6; 5 connected to 6. Not a K4.

Wait, original edges: vertex 2 is connected to 0,1,4,5,7. Vertex 3 is connected to 0,1,4,5,6,7. So vertex 2 and 3 are not connected. So vertex 3 can be Yellow even if vertex 2 is Yellow.

Check if any four are all connected to each other. For example, 3 is connected to 4,5,6,7. Let's see if 4,5,6,7 form a clique. 4 is connected to 5. 5 is connected to 6 and 7. 6 is connected to 5 and 7. 7 is connected to 5 and 6. But 4 is not connected to 6 or 7 except through 5. So 4 is connected to 5, but not to 6 or 7. So no, 4,5,6,7 are not a clique. How about 3,4,5,7? 3 is connected to 4,5,7. 4 is connected to 5. 5 is connected to 7. But 3 and 5 are connected? Yes, 3-5 is an edge. 3-7 is an edge. 4-5 is an edge. 4-3 is an edge. 5-7 is an edge. Wait, but is there a 4-node clique here? Let's see: 3,4,5,7. Are all pairs connected except maybe between some? 3 and 4: yes. 3 and 5: yes. 3 and 7: yes. 4 and 5: yes. 4 and 7: 4 is connected to 7? Let me check the edges. The edges for 4 are: 0,1,2,3,5. So 4 is connected to 0,1,2,3,5. Not connected to 6 or 7. Wait, wait, no. Wait, in the given edge list, the edges for 4 are: (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,5). So 4 is connected to 0,1,2,3,5. So 4 is not connected to 6 or 7. Therefore, 4 is not connected to 7. So in the group 3,4,5,7: 4 and 7 are not connected, so that's not a clique. How about 3,5,6,7? 3 is connected to 5,6,7. 5 is connected to 6 and 7. 6 is connected to 5 and 7. So 3,5,6,7: 3 is connected to 5,6,7. 5 is connected to 6 and 7. 6 is connected to 7. But 3 is connected to all of them, but the others form a triangle. But 3 and 6: edge exists. 3 and 5: yes. 3 and 7: yes. So 3,5,6,7: each pair is connected except between 3 and 6? Wait, 3 is connected to 6. Let me check. The edges for 3: (0,3), (1,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7). So yes, 3 is connected to 6. So in this case, 3,5,6,7 form a complete subgraph? Let's see. 3-5: yes. 3-6: yes. 3-7: yes. 5-6: yes. 5-7: yes. 6-7: yes. Wait, so 5,6,7 form a triangle (clique of 3), and 3 is connected to all three. So 3,5,6,7 form a complete graph? Wait, no. Because in a complete graph of four nodes, every node is connected to every other node. But in this case, 3 is connected to 5,6,7, and 5 is connected to 6 and 7, and 6 is connected to 7. So in that group, the only missing edges are between 3 and 5,6,7? No, 3 is connected to all of them. Wait, no. Wait, 3 is connected to 5,6,7, and 5,6,7 are all connected to each other. So 3,5,6,7 form a clique of size 4. Because each node is connected to every other node in the group. Let's verify:

Line 63
So 2 is connected to 0,1,4,7. 3 is connected to 0,1,4,5,6,7. So 2 and 3 are not connected. Therefore, there's no edge between 2 and 3. So in the group 0,2,3,4,5,6,7, there's no K5. Similarly, checking other possibilities. How about the K3,3? Let's see. Maybe the graph has a bipartite K3,3. For example, vertices 0 and 1 each connected to 2-7. So 0 and 1 are two vertices connected to six others. That would form a K2,6, which is bipartite and planar. Wait, but K3,3 is a bipartition with three nodes on each side. Let me see if there's a K3,3 subgraph. For example, take 0,1,2 and 3,4,5. Are all edges present between the partitions? 0 connected to 3,4,5: yes. 1 connected to 3,4,5: yes. 2 connected to 3,4,5: 2 is connected to 4, but not to 3 or 5. So no. So that's not a K3,3. Maybe another combination. Alternatively, take vertices 0,1,3 and 5,6,7. 0 connected to 5,6,7: yes. 1 connected to 5,6,7: yes. 3 connected to 5,6,7: yes. So 0,1,3 each connected to 5,6,7. That's a K3,3. So yes, this is a complete bipartite graph K3,3 with partitions {0,1,3} and {5,6,7}. Therefore, by Kuratowski's theorem, the graph is non-planar. Therefore, the four-color theorem doesn't apply here. So it's possible that the chromatic number is higher than 4. But the problem allows four colors. So maybe it's still 4-colorable despite being non-planar. Let me try to find a coloring.

Wait, original edges for 1 are (0,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,6), (1,7). So 1 is connected to 0,2,3,4,6,7. So 1 is not connected to 5.

So in this group, there's no K5 because not all pairs are connected. For example, 1 is not connected to 5, 1 isn't connected to 5. So that's missing. Similarly, maybe check another group.

Vertex 6 is connected to 0,1,2,3,4,5,7. Wait, 0,1,2,3,4,5,7—so that's seven edges. Degree 7! That's the highest. So vertex 6 is connected to all except itself and maybe none? Wait, the vertices are 0-7. So 0,1,2,3,4,5,7—yes, that's all except 6. So vertex 6 is connected to every other vertex. Wait, no. Wait, 0 is connected to 6. 1 is connected to 6. 2 is connected to 6. 3 is connected to 6. 4 is connected to 6. 5 is connected to 6. 7 is connected to 6. So vertex 6 is connected to all other seven vertices. Wait, but the graph only has 8 vertices. So vertex 6 is adjacent to 0,1,2,3,4,5,7. So its degree is 7. That's a problem because in graph coloring, the number of colors needed is at least the maximum degree plus one if it's a clique. But here, vertex 6 is connected to all others except itself. But since the graph isn't a complete graph (since, for example, 0 and 2 are not connected directly, unless there's an edge between them). Wait, checking edges: edges for 0 are 0-1, 0-3, 0-6, 0-7. So 0 is not connected to 2,4,5. Similarly, vertex 2 is connected to 3,4,5,6,7. So 2 isn't connected to 0 or 1. But vertex 6 is connected to everyone except itself, which is vertex 6. So vertex 6 has degree 7. That means in any coloring, vertex 6 must have a color different from all seven neighbors. But since we only have four colors, how is that possible? Wait, wait, the four-color theorem says that any planar graph can be colored with four colors. But first, is this graph planar? Wait, but maybe it's not planar. Because if vertex 6 is connected to seven other vertices, then if the graph is planar, it must satisfy certain conditions. For example, Kuratowski's theorem says that a planar graph cannot contain a subgraph that is a complete graph K5 or a complete bipartite graph K3,3. But vertex 6 is connected to seven vertices. If those seven vertices form a K7, but that's impossible because K7 is not planar. However, in our case, the neighbors of 6 are vertices 0,1,2,3,4,5,7. Are these seven vertices forming a complete graph among themselves? Let's check. Let's look at the edges between them.

Looking for a complete subgraph with four vertices. Let's see. For example, vertices 4,5,6,7. Let's check their connections. 4 is connected to 5,6,7. 5 is connected to 4,6,7. 6 is connected to 4,5,7. 7 is connected to 4,5,6. So yes, 4-5-6-7 form a complete graph K4. Because each vertex is connected to every other vertex in the set. So that's a 4-clique. Therefore, the chromatic number is at least 4. Since we have a K4 subgraph, we need at least four colors. So, since the problem allows four colors, it's possible that the graph is 4-colorable. But we need to confirm whether it can be colored with four colors without conflicts.

First, let me note the edges for each vertex. Starting with vertex 0: it's connected to 3,4,5,6,7. That's a lot of edges—so vertex 0 has degree 5. Similarly, vertex 1 is connected to 4,5,7. Vertex 2 is connected to 3,4,5,6,7—another degree 5. Vertex 3 is connected to 0,2,5,6,7. Vertex 4 is connected to 0,1,2,5,6,7. Vertex 5 is connected to 0,1,2,3,4,6,7—so that's degree 7! Vertex 6 is connected to 0,2,3,4,5,7. Vertex 7 is connected to 0,1,2,3,4,5,6—degree 7 as well.

0 is connected to 1,2,4,5,6,7. That's a lot—vertex 0 has degree 6. Then 1 is connected to 0,2,5,6,7. So vertex 1 also has several edges. Vertex 2 is connected to 0,1,3,4,6,7. So vertex 2 has degree 6 as well. Vertex 3 is connected to 2,5,6,7. Vertex 4 is connected to 0,2,5,6,7. Vertex 5 is connected to 0,1,3,4,7. Vertex 6 is connected to 0,1,2,3,4,7. Wait, let me check that again. The edge list includes (0,6), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (6,7). So vertex 6 is connected to 0,1,2,3,4,7—so that's degree 6. Vertex 7 is connected to 0,1,2,3,4,5,6. Wait, edges for 7: (0,7), (1,7), (2,7), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7), (6,7). So vertex 7 has degree 7. That's the highest.

Line 26
A graph is planar if it can be drawn in the plane without edge crossings. Kuratowski's theorem says a graph is non-planar if it contains a subgraph that is a complete graph K5 or K3,3. Let's see. The original graph has vertex 7 connected to all others, so the subgraph including vertex 7 and any four other vertices would form a K5. For example, vertices 0,1,2,3,7: 7 is connected to all, and 0 is connected to 1,2, etc. Wait, but K5 requires that every pair is connected. So if we take 0,1,2,3,7, then 0 is connected to 1,2, but not necessarily to 3. Wait, in the original edges, vertex 0 is connected to 1,2,4,5,6,7. So 0 is not connected to 3. So the subgraph 0,1,2,3,7 would not be a K5, because 0 and 3 are not connected. Similarly, check if any subset forms K5. Let's see: vertex 0 is connected to 1,2,4,5,6,7. Let's take 0,1,2,4,5. Are they all connected to each other? 0 is connected to all. 1 is connected to 0,2,5, etc. Check edges between them: (0,1), (0,2), (0,4), (0,5), (1,2), (1,5), (4,5). But 1 and 4: are they connected? In the original edge list, I don't see (1,4). Similarly, 2 and 5: (0,2), (0,5), (2,4), (2,5) is not in the edge list. Wait, looking back, edges for 2 are (0,2), (1,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,6), (2,7). So 2 is connected to 0,1,3,4,6,7. So 2 is not connected to 5. So in the subset 0,1,2,4,5, the connections are: 0 connected to all, 1 connected to 0,2,5, 2 connected to 0,1,4, 4 connected to 0,2,5, 5 connected to 0,1,4. So in this subset, 1 is not connected to 4, 2 is not connected to 5. So not a complete graph. So maybe K5 isn't present. How about K3,3? For example, a bipartition of 3 and 3 vertices with all edges between. Let's see. Maybe vertices 0,1,2 connected to 4,5,6. But need to check if all edges exist. But in the original graph, 0 is connected to 4,5,6; 1 is connected to 5,6; 2 is connected to 4,6. So 0 connects to 4,5,6; 1 connects to 5,6; 2 connects to 4,6. But 1 isn't connected to 4, and 2 isn't connected to 5. So that's not a complete bipartite graph. Hmm. Maybe another set. Alternatively, perhaps the graph is planar. But maybe this approach isn't helpful. Let's try to think of coloring.

So in this subgraph (excluding vertex 1), the vertices are highly interconnected. For example, 4 is connected to 0,2,3,5,6,7. So vertex 4 has six edges in this subgraph. Similarly, 5 is connected to 0,2,3,4,6,7. So vertex 5 also has six edges here. 6 is connected to 0,3,4,5,7. 7 is connected to 0,2,3,4,5,6. So each of these vertices has a high degree.

Looking for a bipartition into two sets of three vertices each with all possible edges between them. For example, maybe vertices 0,1,2 connected to 3,4,5. But I need to check if all edges exist. It's getting complicated. Alternatively, maybe the graph is non-planar, which would mean it might require more than four colors, but the four-color theorem only applies to planar graphs. However, if the graph is non-planar, it could still be 4-colorable. For example, K5 is non-planar and requires 5 colors, but other non-planar graphs might need fewer.

Vertex 3 is connected to 4 (Red),5 (Green),6 (Blue),7 (Yellow). So 3 must be a different color from all four. But we only have four colors. So impossible. Wait, that's a problem.

Let me try to assign colors step by step. Let's pick vertex 0 first. Let's color it Red. Then its neighbors (1,2,3,4,5) can't be Red. Let's look at vertex 1. Let's color it Green. Then vertex 1's neighbors (0,3,4,5,6,7) can't be Green. Then vertex 2. Let's color it Blue. Vertex 2's neighbors are 0,3,4,6,7. So Blue can't be used for 3,4,6,7. Then vertex 3. It's connected to 0 (Red), 1 (Green), 2 (Blue), 5,6,7. So possible color for 3 is Yellow. So color 3 Yellow. Then vertex 4. It's connected to 0 (Red),1 (Green), 2 (Blue),6,7. So possible color: Yellow. Let's check if that's okay. But vertex 4 is connected to 3 (Yellow), so 4 can't be Yellow. Wait, vertex 4 is connected to 3? Wait, looking back at edges: (1,4), (2,4), (4,6), (4,7). Wait, 3 and 4 are not connected. Because in the edge list, I don't see (3,4). Wait, edges for 3 are (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7). So 3 is not connected to 4. So vertex 4 can be Yellow, since it's only connected to 0 (Red),1 (Green),2 (Blue),6,7. So color 4 Yellow. Then vertex 5. It's connected to 0 (Red),1 (Green),3 (Yellow),6,7. So possible colors: Blue. Let's color 5 Blue. Now check if Blue is allowed. Vertex 5 is connected to 1 (Green), so Blue is okay. But vertex 5 is connected to 3 (Yellow) and 0 (Red), so yes, Blue is available. So now vertices 1-5 are colored Green, Blue, Yellow, Yellow, Blue. Wait, but vertex 3 is Yellow and vertex 4 is Yellow. Are they connected? No, because there's no edge between 3 and 4, so that's okay. Similarly, vertex 5 is Blue and vertex 2 is Blue. Are they connected? Vertex 2 and 5: looking at edges, vertex 2 is connected to 3,4,6,7. No edge between 2 and 5. So that's okay.

Now, moving to vertex 6. Vertex 6 is connected to 1 (Green), 2 (Blue), 3 (Yellow),4 (Yellow),5 (Blue),7. So adjacent colors are Green, Blue, Yellow, Yellow, Blue. So available color for 6 is Red. Let's color 6 Red. Then vertex 7. Connected to 1 (Green),2 (Blue),3 (Yellow),4 (Yellow),5 (Blue),6 (Red). So adjacent colors are Green, Blue, Yellow, Yellow, Blue, Red. So all four colors are used. So we need a color not in {Green, Blue, Yellow, Red} but we only have four colors. Wait, that's a problem. Because vertex 7 is connected to all four colors? Let's check again.

Take vertices 0,3,4,6,7. 0 is connected to 3,4,6,7. 3 is connected to 0,4,6,7. 4 is connected to 0,3,6,7. 6 is connected to 0,3,4,7. 7 is connected to all. But 0 and 7 are connected, 3 and 7 are connected, etc. However, in the original edges, does 0 connect to 1? No. So vertices 0,3,4,6,7: 0 is connected to 3,4,6,7. 3 is connected to 0,4,6,7. 4 is connected to 0,3,6,7. 6 is connected to 0,3,4,7. 7 is connected to all. But between 0 and 3, yes. But in this group, 0-3-4-6-7: each pair is connected except perhaps some. Wait, 0 and 3 are connected. 0 and 4: yes. 0 and 6: yes. 0 and 7: yes. 3 and 4: yes. 3 and 6: yes. 3 and 7: yes. 4 and 6: yes. 4 and 7: yes. 6 and 7: yes. So the subgraph induced by 0,3,4,6,7 is a complete graph K5. Because all pairs are connected. Therefore, this is a K5. Therefore, the original graph contains a K5 as a subgraph, which is a 5-clique. Therefore, the chromatic number is at least 5. But the problem allows only four colors. Therefore, it's impossible to color this graph with four colors. Therefore, the answer is Impossible.

Vertex 2 is connected to 1,3,4,6,7. So vertex 2 is connected to 4. Vertex 0 is connected to 4. So vertex 0 and 4 are connected. So if vertex 0 is Green, vertex 4 can't be Green. Let's try coloring vertex 2 as Yellow. Then vertex 2 is Yellow. Then vertex 3 is connected to 0 (Green), 1 (Blue), 2 (Yellow). So vertex 3 can't take any of those colors, but we only have three colors here (Green, Blue, Yellow). So again, vertex 3 can't be colored.

Vertex 1 is connected to 3,4,5 (all Green), so 1 can't be Green. Also, 1 can't be Red or Blue (connected to 6 and 7). So 1 must be Yellow. But 1 is connected to 0 (Yellow), which is a conflict. So that's no good.

Alternatively, maybe vertex 7 is part of a clique. A clique is a set of vertices where each is connected to every other. The maximum clique size here: for example, looking at vertex 7 connected to everyone else, but the other vertices may not form a clique among themselves. Let's see. For example, vertex 0 is connected to 1,4,5,7. But 0 is not connected to 2,3,6. So the maximum clique size in the graph might be... Let's check. For example, vertices 1,2,4,5,6,7 all connected to each other? Let's see. Wait, 1 is connected to 2,4,6,7, but 2 is connected to 4,5,6,7. But 1 and 5: are they connected?

Now, vertex 5 is connected to 2 (Green), 4 (Blue), and 6 (Yellow). So vertex 5 can't be Green, Blue, or Yellow. But we only have three colors. Wait, this is a problem. Because vertex 5 is connected to all three colors, so no color left. Unless we use a fourth color, but in the subgraph, we're limited to three colors (since vertex 7 is Red). So this suggests that the subgraph is not 3-colorable, making the original graph not 4-colorable.

A graph is planar if it can be drawn in the plane without edge crossings.

First, maybe start with vertex 0. Let's color it red. Then its neighbors (1,2,3,5,6,7) can't be red. Let's look at vertex 1. It's adjacent to 0 (red), so possible colors: green, blue, yellow. Let's pick green for vertex 1. Then vertex 2 is adjacent to both 0 (red) and 1 (green). So possible colors: blue, yellow. Let's pick blue for vertex 2. Then vertex 3 is adjacent to 0 (red), 1 (green), and 2 (blue). So it can't be red, green, blue. So the only color left is yellow. So vertex 3 is yellow. Then vertex 5 is adjacent to 0 (red), 1 (green), and 2 (blue). So possible colors: yellow. Wait, but vertex 3 is yellow and vertex 3 is adjacent to 5? Let me check the edges. The edges for 5: connected to 0,1,2,4,6,7. Wait, 5 is connected to 4? Yes, edge (4,5) is in the list. So vertex 5 is connected to 0,1,2,4,6,7. So if we try to color vertex 5 yellow, but vertex 3 is yellow, but vertex 5 is not connected to 3. Wait, no. Vertex 5 is connected to 0,1,2,4,6,7. So 5 is not connected to 3. So vertex 3 is yellow, but vertex 5 can be yellow? Wait, no. Wait, vertex 3 is connected to 4,7, but not to 5. Wait, let me check the edges again. The edges for 3 are (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (3,4), (3,7). So no, vertex 3 is not connected to 5. So vertex 5 can be yellow. But wait, vertex 5 is adjacent to 0 (red), 1 (green), 2 (blue). So the available color is yellow. So color vertex 5 yellow. Then vertex 4 is adjacent to 1 (green), 2 (blue), 3 (yellow), 5 (yellow). So vertex 4 can't be green, blue, or yellow. So it has to be red. But vertex 4 is connected to 5 (yellow), which is okay. So vertex 4 is red. Then vertex 6 is connected to 0 (red), 2 (blue), 4 (red), 5 (yellow), 7. So adjacent to red, blue, red, yellow. So possible colors: green. So vertex 6 is green. Then vertex 7 is connected to 0 (red), 2 (blue), 3 (yellow), 4 (red), 5 (yellow), 6 (green). So adjacent colors: red, blue, yellow, red, yellow, green. So available color: none. Wait, red, blue, yellow, green are all used. So vertex 7 can't be colored. That's a problem. So this coloring attempt failed because vertex 7 has no available color.

So vertex 7 is adjacent to all other 7 vertices. That's going to complicate things because in the coloring, vertex 7 must have a different color from all of them. Since there are four colors, as long as the other vertices don't use all four colors, then it's possible. But since vertex 7 is connected to 7 vertices, which are all the others, each of those 7 must have different colors than vertex 7. But since there are only four colors, maybe we can manage.

Similarly, check another group. Let's see vertex 1 is connected to 0,2,3,4,6,7. So 1 is connected to 2,3,4, etc. Let's check if vertices 1,2,3,4 form a complete subgraph. 1 is connected to 2,3,4. 2 is connected to 1,3,4. 3 is connected to 1,2,4. 4 is connected to 1,2,3. Wait, but 1-2 is connected, 1-3, 1-4, 2-3, 2-4, 3-4. Wait, 3-4: Looking at the edge list, (3,4) is not present. Wait, the edges for 3 are (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7). So 3 is not connected to 4. So the subgraph 1,2,3,4 is missing the edge between 3 and 4. Therefore, it's not a complete graph. So K4 is not present. How about another set? Let's check 2,3,5,6,7. 2 is connected to 3,5,6,7. 3 is connected to 2,5,6,7. 5 is connected to 2,3,6,7. 6 is connected to 2,3,5,7. 7 is connected to all. So 2,3,5,6,7: each connected to each other except maybe between 5 and 6? Wait, 5 is connected to 6 (edge 21). So 2,3,5,6,7: each pair is connected. So that's a K5. Because in this set, each vertex is connected to every other vertex. Let's verify:

Looking at the edges, let's see if there's a K5 subgraph. For example, vertex 5 is connected to 0,1,2,3,4,6,7. So any five of these connected to each other? Let's check if 5,1,2,3,4 form a K5. 5 is connected to all of them. But are 1,2,3,4 all connected to each other? 1 is connected to 3,4; 2 is connected to 3,4; 3 is connected to 1,2,4 (since 3 is connected to 1,2,5,6,7; but not directly to 4. Wait, vertex 3's edges: connected to 1,2,5,6,7. So 3 is not connected to 4. Therefore, 3 and 4 are not adjacent. Similarly, 1 and 2: are they connected? Let's check. The edges for 0: (0,1), (0,2).

This seems to be a recurring problem. Maybe the graph is not 4-colorable? But wait, the four-color theorem says any planar graph is 4-colorable. But wait, is this graph planar? Let me check. Wait, the four-color theorem applies to planar graphs, but if this graph is non-planar, it might require more colors. But I don't know if this graph is planar or not. Let's think: A planar graph cannot contain a complete graph of five nodes (K5) as a subgraph. Let's see if there's a K5 here. For example, vertices 0,1,4,5,6: 0 is connected to 1,4,5,6. 1 is connected to 4,5,6. 4 is connected to 5,6. 5 is connected to 6. But this isn't a complete graph because 0 isn't connected to 3, but maybe another subset. Wait, vertex 6 is connected to all except maybe 3? Wait, no, vertex 6 is connected to 0,1,2,3,4,5,7. So if we take vertices 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7, but that's the whole graph. Wait, but K5 requires five mutually connected nodes. Let's see, for example, 1,3,4,5,6. Are they all connected? 1 is connected to 3,4,5,6. 3 is connected to 4,5,6,7. 4 is connected to 5,6. 5 is connected to 6. So in this subset, 1 is connected to all except maybe 3. Wait, 1 is connected to 3. So 1-3 is an edge. 1-4, 1-5, 1-6. 3 is connected to 4,5,6. 4 is connected to 5 and 6. 5 is connected to 6. So in this subset, it's not a complete graph because 3 isn't connected to 4,5,6? Wait, no, edges are (3,4), (3,5), (3,6). So in the subset {1,3,4,5,6}, each node is connected to the others except perhaps 1 and 3: they are connected. So 1 is connected to all in the subset except maybe 4,5,6: no, 1 is connected to 4,5,6. Wait, in subset {1,3,4,5,6}, 1 is connected to 3,4,5,6. 3 is connected to 1,4,5,6. 4 is connected to 1,3,5,6. 5 is connected to 1,3,4,6. 6 is connected to 1,3,4,5. So yes, this is a K5. Because each node in the subset is connected to every other node. Wait, no, 1 is connected to 3,4,5,6. But 3 is connected to 1,4,5,6. Similarly, all pairs in this subset have edges. So {1,3,4,5,6} forms a K5. Therefore, the graph contains a K5 subgraph, which is non-planar. Therefore, the four-color theorem doesn't apply here. Wait, but the four-color theorem is for planar graphs. So if the graph is non-planar, it might still be 4-colorable, but it's not guaranteed. However, the presence of K5 would require at least 5 colors. Because K5 is a complete graph of five nodes, which requires five colors. So if this graph contains a K5, then it's not 4-colorable. Therefore, the answer should be impossible.

Similarly, vertex 7 is connected to 0,1,2,3,4,5,6. So both 6 and 7 have degree 7, meaning they each connect to all other 7 vertices.

So when coloring, vertex 7 must have a color different from all other vertices. Since there are 7 neighbors (vertices 0-6), but we have four colors. So if we can assign colors to vertices 0-6 such that among them, no two adjacent ones share the same color, and also none of them share the same color as vertex 7. Wait, but vertex 7 is connected to all of them, so each of 0-6 must have a color different from each other and from vertex 7. Wait, no. Because vertex 7's color only needs to be different from each of its neighbors (which are 0-6). The colors of the other vertices (0-6) only need to be different from their own neighbors, which may or may not include each other. But since vertex 7 is connected to all, each of 0-6 must have a different color from 7, but not necessarily from each other unless they are adjacent.

Alternatively, vertex 1 is Green, vertex 4 is Blue. Vertex 5 is connected to 1 (Green), so it can't be Green. Let's assign Blue to 5. But vertex 5 is connected to 4 (Blue), so that's a conflict.

Let's assign Green. But vertex 3 is connected to 0 (Red), so that's okay. Wait, no, vertex 0 is Red, and vertex 3 is connected to 0. Wait, vertex 3 is in the 1-7 subgraph, so vertex 3 is connected to 0, which is Red, so vertex 3 can't be Red. So if vertex 3 is Green, then that's okay.

Alternatively, maybe the graph is not 4-colorable. Let me check if there's a clique of size 4. A clique is a set of vertices where each is connected to every other.

Vertex 3 is connected to 0,1,5,6,7. Vertex 4 is connected to 1,2,6,7. Vertex 5 is connected to 0,3,6,7. Vertex 6 is connected to 0,1,2,3,4,5,7. Wait, vertex 6 is connected to almost everyone except maybe 4? Wait, checking the edges: (4,6) is present, yes. So vertex 6 is connected to 0,1,2,3,4,5,7. That's all except itself. So degree 7. Similarly, vertex 7 is connected to 0,1,3,4,5,6. So degree 6. So vertex 6 is connected to all except maybe vertex 4? Wait, no: edge (4,6) is present. So vertex 6 is connected to 0,1,2,3,4,5,7. All seven other vertices. So vertex 6 has degree 7. Hmm. That's a high degree.

1 is connected to 0,6,7,5 (since 1 is connected to 5? Wait, looking back, the edges for 1 are (1,0), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,6), (1,7). So 1 is not connected to 5. So 1 is connected to 0,2,3,4,6,7. So in subset 0,1,5,6,7: 0 connected to 1,5,6,7. 1 connected to 0,6,7. 5 connected to 0,3,6,7. 6 connected to 0,1,5,7. 7 connected to 0,1,5,6. So, does this subset form a K5? Let's see: 0 is connected to all except maybe others. Wait, 0 is connected to 1,5,6,7 in this subset. 1 is connected to 0,6,7. 5 is connected to 0,6,7. 6 is connected to all. 7 is connected to all. Wait, but 5 and 1 are not connected. So no, there's no edge between 1 and 5, so that subset isn't a complete graph.

But the subgraph 0-6 is connected with a lot of edges. Let me check if it's 3-colorable. Alternatively, maybe it's 4-colorable. Wait, but since we have four colors in total, maybe even if the subgraph needs four colors, we can still color vertex 7 with a fifth color, but since we don't have a fifth color, it's impossible. Wait, but the question allows four colors. So if the subgraph of vertices 0-6 is 4-colorable, then vertex 7 can take the fifth color, but we don't have that. Therefore, the problem is impossible if the subgraph of vertices 0-6 is 4-chromatic. Wait, but perhaps vertex 7's neighbors (0-6) form a graph that is 4-colorable, and then 7 can take a different color. Wait, but in total, we have four colors. So if the subgraph of 0-6 can be colored with four colors such that each of them uses a color different from each other (but they can have same colors as long as adjacent ones don't), then vertex 7 can take the fifth color. But since we only have four colors, this would not work. Therefore, if the subgraph induced by 0-6 is 4-colorable, then the entire graph is 4-colorable only if vertex 7 can take the fourth color not used by its neighbors. Wait, but the neighbors are 0-6. If 0-6 are colored with four colors, then vertex 7 has neighbors that might use all four colors, making it impossible to color 7. Therefore, the problem would be impossible. But perhaps the subgraph 0-6 is 3-colorable, allowing vertex 7 to take the fourth color. So let's check.

Hmm. Let's see. Vertex 0 is connected to 2,4,5,6,7. So degree 5. Vertex 1 is connected to 2,4,5,6,7. Also degree 5. Vertex 2 is connected to 0,1,3,5,6,7. Degree 6. Vertex 3 is connected to 2,4,5,6,7.

Vertex 7 is connected to 0,1,2,3,4,5,6. Also degree 7. Wait, so vertices 5,6,7 all have degree 7, meaning they are connected to every other vertex except themselves. So 5,6,7 form a clique? Wait, no. Because a clique is a complete subgraph where every two vertices are connected. Let me check. For example, 5 is connected to 6 and 7. 6 is connected to 7. So 5,6,7 form a triangle. But also, each of them is connected to many other vertices. But wait, 5 is connected to 0,1,2,3,4,6,7. So except for 5 itself, all others. Similarly for 6 and 7. So each of 5,6,7 is connected to all the other vertices except themselves. So the graph is almost complete. Wait, but vertices 0,1,2,3,4 have varying degrees.

Vertex 5: connected to 2 (Red), 0 (Green), 1 (Blue). So must be Y or G or B. But adjacent to Red, Green, Blue. So must be Yellow. But wait, vertex 5 is also connected to 3 (Green) and 4 (Yellow). So when we color vertex 5, it's connected to 2 (Red), 0 (Green), 1 (Blue), 3 (Green), 4 (Yellow). Therefore, the colors used by its neighbors are Red, Green, Blue, Yellow. Wait, but we are only allowed to use Green, Blue, Yellow for vertices other than 2. But vertex 5 is connected to 4 (Yellow), which is allowed. Wait, but vertex 5 is in the group that can't be Red. So vertex 5's color must be different from Red, and also different from its neighbors. But its neighbors include 0 (Green), 1 (Blue), 2 (Red), 3 (Green), 4 (Yellow). So the colors used by its neighbors are Red, Green, Blue, Yellow. But since vertex 5 is in the subgraph that can't use Red, but its neighbors already use all three available colors (Green, Blue, Yellow). Wait, that's a problem. Because vertex 5 must be colored with Green, Blue, or Yellow, but all three are already used by its neighbors. Therefore, this coloring attempt fails at vertex 5.

The edges for 7 are listed as (0,7), (1,7), (2,7), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7), (6,7). So yes, vertex 7 is connected to all other 7 vertices. So vertex 7 has degree 7, which is the highest.

Looking at vertex 0. It's connected to 1,2,3,5,6,7. Since 7 is Red, 0 can be Green, Blue, or Yellow. Let's try Green. So vertex 0 is Green. Now, its neighbors (1,2,3,5,6) can't be Green. Let's move to vertex 1. It's connected to 0 (Green), 2,4,5,6,7 (Red). So vertex 1 can't be Green or Red. So options: Blue or Yellow. Let's pick Blue. So vertex 1 is Blue. Now, its neighbors: 2,4,5,6. They can't be Blue. Next, vertex 2. It's connected to 0 (Green), 1 (Blue), 3,4,7 (Red). So vertex 2 can't be Green, Blue, or Red. So only Yellow is left. So vertex 2 is Yellow. Now, vertex 2's neighbors: 3,4,7 (Red). So 3 and 4 can't be Yellow. Now, vertex 3 is connected to 0 (Green), 2 (Yellow), 4,5,6,7 (Red). So vertex 3 can't be Green, Yellow, or Red. So options: Blue. Assign Blue to vertex 3. But wait, vertex 3 is connected to vertex 1 (Blue). Oh no, that's a problem. Because vertex 3 is connected to vertex 1, which is Blue. So vertex 3 can't be Blue.

Then 5 is connected to 0,1,2,3,6,7. So 5 is connected to 0, which is a neighbor of 2. Hmm, but the key is whether the neighbors of 2 are interconnected. Let's check if 4 is connected to any of 0,5,6,7. The edges for 4 are (1,4), (2,4), (4,6), (4,7). So 4 is connected to 1,2,6,7. So 4 is connected to 6 and 7, which are neighbors of 2. Also, 5 is connected to 6 and 7. So maybe the neighbors of 2 form a subgraph where some are connected. For instance, 5 is connected to 6,7; 6 is connected to 7. So maybe the neighbors of 2 include a clique? Let's see: 5,6,7 are all connected to each other. So 5-6, 5-7, 6-7 are edges. So that's a triangle (clique of size 3). Then 0 is connected to 5,6,7. So 0 is part of that group. So maybe 0,5,6,7 form a K4? Wait, 0 is connected to 5,6,7. But 5 is connected to 6 and 7, and 6 is connected to 7. But 0 isn't connected to 1, but 5 is connected to 1.

Vertex 5 is connected to 0, 1, 3, 4, 7. Five edges. Vertex 6 is connected to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7. Six edges. Vertex 7 is connected to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Wait, that's seven edges. Let me check: edges for 7 are (0,7), (1,7), (2,7), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7), (6,7). Yep, seven edges. So vertex 7 has degree 7.

But let's see. Let's check if any 5 vertices form a complete subgraph. For example, vertex 0 is connected to 1,2,3,5,6,7. Let's check if 0,1,2,3,7 form a K5. Let's see: 0 connected to all. 1 connected to 0,2,7 (yes). 1 connected to 3? Let's check the edges. 1 is connected to 0,2,4,5,6,7. So 1 is not connected to 3. So 0,1,2,3,7: 1 and 3 are not connected, so not a complete graph. How about 0,2,3,4,7? 0 connected to all. 2 connected to 3,4,7. 3 connected to 4,7. 4 connected to 7. Let's check all pairs: 0 is connected to all. 2-3: yes. 2-4: yes. 2-7: yes. 3-4: yes. 3-7: yes. 4-7: yes. So in this group, 0 is connected to all. 2 is connected to 0,3,4,7. 3 is connected to 0,2,4,7. 4 is connected to 0,2,3,7. 7 is connected to all. Wait, 0,2,3,4,7: each pair is connected except maybe between some. Wait, 2 and 4 are connected. 3 and 4 are connected. So 0 connected to everyone. 2 connected to 0,3,4,7. 3 connected to 0,2,4,7. 4 connected to 0,2,3,7. 7 connected to everyone. Wait, so in this subset, 0 is connected to all, 7 is connected to all. Then 2,3,4 are connected among themselves. So let's check if 0,2,3,4,7 form a complete graph. 0 is connected to all. 2 is connected to 0,3,4,7. 3 is connected to 0,2,4,7. 4 is connected to 0,2,3,7. 7 is connected to all. So yes, each pair is connected except maybe between 2 and 7? Wait, no, 2 is connected to 7. 2-7 is in the edge list. Similarly, 3-7 is present. 4-7 is present. So yes, in this subset of 5 vertices: 0,2,3,4,7, every pair is connected. So this is a K5 subgraph. Therefore, the graph contains a K5, which requires 5 colors. But the problem allows only 4 colors. Therefore, the graph is not four-colorable. Hence, it's impossible.

Let's pick vertex 0 and assign it Red. Then, its neighbors (1,2,4,5,6,7) can't be Red. Let's color vertex 1 Green. Now, vertex 1's neighbors (0,2,3,4,6,7) can't be Green. So vertex 2, which is adjacent to 0 (Red) and 1 (Green), can't be Red or Green. Let's color vertex 2 Blue. Now, vertex 2's neighbors (0,1,5,6,7) can't be Blue. Next, vertex 3, which is adjacent to 1 (Green) and others. Let's color vertex 3 Yellow. Then, vertex 3's neighbors (1,4,5,6,7) can't be Yellow. Now, vertex 4 is adjacent to 0 (Red),1 (Green),3 (Yellow),5,6,7. So vertex 4 can't be Red, Green, or Yellow. So it must be Blue. But vertex 4 is adjacent to vertex 2 (Blue), so that's a conflict. So vertex 4 can't be Blue. Therefore, this coloring fails.

Yes. 1 and 6? Yes. 1 and 7? Yes. 3 and 5? Let's check edge (3,5). Wait, in the edge list, (3,5) isn't listed. The edges for 3 are: (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (3,4), (3,6), (3,7). So 3 is not connected to 5. So 0,1,3,5,6,7: 0 is connected to all except each other? No, because 3 isn't connected to 5. So that's not a complete subgraph. Similarly, maybe another group. Let's check 0,1,5,6,7. 0 is connected to all, 1 is connected to 5,6,7. 5 is connected to 6 and 7. 6 is connected to 7. So that's a K5?

Looking at the edges, let's see if any 5-clique exists. For example, let's check vertices 0,1,2,3,6. Are they all connected to each other? 0 is connected to 1,2,3,6. 1 is connected to 0,2,3,6. 2 is connected to 0,1,3,6. 3 is connected to 0,1,2,6. 6 is connected to 0,1,2,3. But does 1 connect to 6? Yes. 0 connects to 6. So in this group, 0,1,2,3,6: each is connected to every other except maybe between 0 and 6? Wait, 0 is connected to 6. So in this group, each vertex is connected to every other. Wait, 0 is connected to 1,2,3,6. 1 is connected to 0,2,3,6. 2 is connected to 0,1,3,6. 3 is connected to 0,1,2,6. 6 is connected to 0,1,2,3. So wait, but does 1 connect to 6? Yes. So in this group, every pair is connected except maybe 0 and 6? No, 0 is connected to 6. Wait, so in this group of 5 vertices (0,1,2,3,6), every pair is connected. So that's a 5-clique (K5). Because each vertex is connected to every other vertex in the group. So K5 is present. Therefore, the graph is non-planar and contains a K5 subgraph, which requires 5 colors. But the problem allows only four colors. Therefore, it's impossible to color this graph with four colors.

Wait, 0 is connected to 3,5,6,7. So in the other partition {3,5,6}, yes, 0 is connected to all. Similarly, 1 is connected to 3,5,6,7. So 1 is connected to all in the other partition. 7 is connected to all in the other partition. So the partitions {0,1,7} and {3,5,6} would form a K3,3, since each vertex in the first partition connects to all in the second. But wait, does 0 connect to 3,5,6? Yes. 1 connects to 3,5,6? 1 is connected to 3, but from the edge list, 1 is connected to 3, but not to 5 or 6. Wait, original edges for 1: (0,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,6), (1,7).

This seems like a pretty dense graph. Let's think about coloring. Since we have four colors available, maybe it's possible. But given that some vertices are connected to many others, their color choices are limited. Let's start with vertex 6, which is connected to all except maybe one. Wait, no, vertex 6 is connected to 0,1,2,3,4,5,7. So every other vertex. So vertex 6 is connected to all 7 others. Similarly, vertex 7 is connected to 0,1,2,3,4,5,6. So vertex 7 is also connected to all except maybe itself. Wait, but in an undirected graph, no loops, so each vertex is connected to others. So 6 and 7 are connected to all other 6 vertices except themselves. Wait, but there are 8 vertices. Wait, 0 through 7 is 8 vertices. So vertex 6 is connected to 0,1,2,3,4,5,7. That's 7 vertices. So indeed, vertex 6 is connected to every other vertex. Similarly, vertex 7 is connected to 0,1,2,3,4,5,6. So they are both connected to everyone else. Therefore, vertices 6 and 7 are each adjacent to all other 6 vertices. So their color must be different from all others. But since there are only four colors, how can that be? Wait, if a vertex is connected to 7 others, then those 7 must all be colored differently? Wait, no. The four-color theorem says that any planar graph can be colored with four colors. But wait, is this graph planar? Wait, planar graphs cannot have a subgraph that's a complete graph of five nodes (K5). Let me check if this graph has a K5. Let's see. For example, vertices 0,1,3,4,6: are they all connected to each other? Let's check. 0 is connected to 1,3,4,6. 1 is connected to 0,3,4,6. 3 is connected to 0,1,4,6. 4 is connected to 0,1,3,6. 6 is connected to all. So 0,1,3,4,6 form a K5? Let's see: edges between all pairs? 0-1, 0-3, 0-4, 0-6. 1-3,1-4,1-6. 3-4 (Wait, is there an edge between 3 and 4? Let me check the edge list. The edges for 3 are (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7). So 3 is connected to 0,1,2,5,6,7. So 3 is not connected to 4. Therefore, the group 0,1,3,4,6: 3 and 4 are not connected. So that's not a K5. How about another group? Let's see 0,1,5,6,7. 0 is connected to 1,5,6,7. 1 is connected to 0,5? Wait, 1 is connected to 0,3,4,6,7. So 1 is not connected to 5. So no, 1-5 isn't an edge. So that's not a K5. Maybe 2,3,4,5,6. 2 is connected to 3,4,5,6,7. 3 is connected to 2,5,6,7. 4 is connected to 2,5,6,7. 5 is connected to 2,3,4,6,7. 6 is connected to 2,3,4,5,7. 7 is connected to 2,3,4,5,6. Wait, but 2 is connected to 3,4,5,6,7. So 2 is connected to all in 3,4,5,6,7. But 3,4,5,6,7: 3 and 4 are not connected (no edge 3-4). So that's not a complete graph. Therefore, maybe the graph is planar? Wait, but the four-color theorem applies to planar graphs, but this graph might not be planar. Wait, but maybe it's non-planar, but since the question is about coloring with four colors regardless of planarity. Wait, the four-color theorem only guarantees that planar graphs can be colored with four colors, but non-planar graphs might require more. But since we are allowed to use four colors here, maybe the graph is 4-colorable even if it's non-planar. Let's not get stuck on that.

So vertex 0 is highly connected. Then vertex 1 is connected to 0, 2, 3, 4, 7. That's five edges. Vertex 2 is connected to 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7—six edges. Vertex 3 is connected to 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7. Also six edges. Vertex 4 is connected to 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7—six edges. Vertex 5 is connected to 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7. Six edges again. Vertex 6 is connected to 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7. Six edges. Vertex 7 is connected to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Wait, that's seven edges. Oh, vertex 7 is connected to all others except maybe itself? Let me check. The edges for 7 are with 0,1,2,3,4,5,6. So yes, vertex 7 is connected to every other vertex except itself. That's a degree of 7, which is the highest.

Looking at the edges, let's see if any five vertices are all connected to each other. For example, vertices 0,1,3,4,5: check if they form a K5. Vertex 0 is connected to 1,3,4,5. Vertex 1 is connected to 0,3,4. Vertex 3 is connected to 0,1,4,5. Vertex 4 is connected to 0,1,3,5. Vertex 5 is connected to 0,3,4. So missing edges: 1-5, 3-5 is present. Wait, vertex 1 and 5: edge (0,5) exists, but (1,5) is not in the edge list. The edges for vertex 1 are (0,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,7). So vertex 1 is not connected to 5. Similarly, vertex 5 is connected to 0,2,3,4,6,7. So no edge between 1 and 5. Therefore, the five vertices 0,1,3,4,5 don't form a K5.

Looking at the edges, vertex 0 is connected to 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7. That's six edges. So vertex 0 is pretty central. Then vertex 1 is connected to 4, 5, 6, 7 in addition to 0. So vertices 0 and 1 are both connected to 5,6,7. Then vertex 2 is connected to 3,4,5,6,7. Vertex 3 is connected to 4,6,7. Vertex 4 is connected to 5,6,7. Vertex 5 is connected to 6 and 7. Vertex 6 is connected to 7 as well. Wait, actually, looking at the edges, maybe some of these connections are overlapping. Let me check again.

Wait, but let's check. The 7 vertices connected to vertex 3 are 0,1,2,4,5,6,7. Let's see the connections among these. For example, vertex 0 is connected to 2,3,4,5,6,7. So vertex 0 is connected to 2,4,5,6,7, but not to 1. Similarly, vertex 1 is connected to 2,3,4,5,6,7 but not to 0. So vertices 0 and 1 are not connected. Vertex 2 is connected to 0,1,3,6,7. So vertex 2 is connected to 0,1,6,7. Vertex 4 is connected to 0,1,3,6,7. Vertex 5 is connected to 0,1,3,6,7. Vertex 6 is connected to everyone except maybe itself. Wait, vertex 6 is connected to 0,1,2,3,4,5,7. So vertex 6 is connected to all except 6 itself. Similarly, vertex 7 is connected to 0,1,2,3,4,5,6. So vertex 7 is connected to all except itself. So among the 7 vertices connected to vertex 3 (0,1,2,4,5,6,7), the connections are quite dense. For example, 6 and 7 are connected to each other. 0 is connected to 2,4,5,6,7. 1 is connected to 2,4,5,6,7. So in this subset of 7 vertices, the subgraph is almost complete, except that 0 and 1 are not connected. Let me see: the subgraph induced by vertices 0,1,2,4,5,6,7. Let's check if this is a complete graph. For example, is 0 connected to 1? No. So that's one missing edge. Similarly, 2 and 4: are they connected? Looking back at the edge list, the edges include (2,3), (2,6), (2,7), but not (2,4). Wait, vertex 2 is connected to 0,1,3,6,7. So vertex 2 is not connected to 4 or 5. Similarly, vertex 4 is connected to 0,1,3,6,7. So vertex 4 is not connected to 2 or 5. Wait, no: vertex 4's edges are (0,4), (1,4), (3,4), (4,6), (4,7). So vertex 4 is not connected to 2 or 5. Similarly, vertex 5's edges: (0,5), (1,5), (3,5), (5,6), (5,7). So vertex 5 is not connected to 2 or 4. So in the subgraph of 0,1,2,4,5,6,7, the edges are:

Hmm, that's a lot of edges. Let me try to visualize the graph. Vertex 0 is connected to 1,3,4,6,7. So vertex 0 has degree 5. Similarly, looking at vertex 1, it's connected to 0,2,4,5,6,7—degree 6. Vertex 2 is connected to 1,3,4,6,7—degree 5. Vertex 3 connected to 0,2,4,5,6,7—degree 6. Vertex 4 connected to 0,1,2,3,5,6,7—degree 7. Wait, vertex 4 has edges to all except maybe itself? Let me check: 0,1,2,3,5,6,7—yes, that's 7 edges. So vertex 4 is connected to every other vertex except perhaps itself. Then vertices 5,6,7 also have high degrees. Let me check vertex 5: connected to 1,3,4,6,7—degree 5. Vertex 6: connected to 0,1,2,3,4,5,7—wait, 0,1,2,3,4,5,7—that's 7 edges. So vertex 6 is connected to all except maybe 5? Wait no, (5,6) is in the edge list. So vertex 6 is connected to 0,1,2,3,4,5,7—yes, all except itself. So vertex 6 has degree 7. Similarly, vertex 7 is connected to 0,1,2,3,4,5,6—all except itself.

So vertex 6 is connected to 0,1,2,3,4,5,7. So that's all except itself, which is impossible, so vertex 6 has degree 7. It's connected to every other vertex. Wait, that can't be right. Let's count: 0 is connected to 6. 1 is connected to 6. 2,3,4,5,7 are all connected to 6. So yes, vertex 6 is connected to all other 7 vertices. So vertex 6 has degree 7, which is the highest possible in an 8-node graph. Similarly, vertex 7: connected to 0,1,2,4,5,6. So that's six edges. So vertex 7 has degree 6.

So yes, 2-3-4-5 are all connected to each other. So that's another clique of size 4. So indeed, the graph has multiple cliques of size 4, so 4 colors are necessary. But since the four-color theorem says that any planar graph is 4-colorable, but if the graph is not planar, then maybe it's not. Wait, but maybe this graph isn't planar. Let me check if it's planar.

First, maybe I should visualize the graph or at least understand its structure. Let me list out the edges again to see how connected each vertex is. Starting from vertex 0: it's connected to 1, 5, 6, 7. So degree 4. Vertex 1 is connected to 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7. That's degree 6, which is pretty high. Vertex 2 is connected to 1, 3, 5, 7. Degree 4. Vertex 3 is connected to 1, 2, 4, 6, 7. Degree 5. Vertex 4 is connected to 1, 3, 5, 6, 7. Degree 5. Vertex 5 is connected to 0, 2, 4, 6, 7. Degree 5. Vertex 6 is connected to 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7. Degree 6. Vertex 7 is connected to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Wait, that's all except itself. So vertex 7 has degree 7. Hmm, that's a problem because in a graph with 8 vertices, vertex 7 is connected to every other vertex. So if vertex 7 is connected to everyone, how can we color it? Since it's adjacent to all others, each of the other 7 vertices must be a different color than vertex 7. But wait, we only have four colors. So vertex 7's color can't conflict with any of its neighbors. However, since there are 7 neighbors, each of which must be a different color from vertex 7, but the neighbors can share colors among themselves as long as they aren't adjacent. Wait, but with four colors, the neighbors can only use three colors (since one is taken by vertex 7). But there are seven neighbors, so by the pigeonhole principle, at least two of them would have to share the same color. But if those two are adjacent, that's a problem. Let's check if all the neighbors of vertex 7 are adjacent to each other.

Now, 1 is connected to 3,4,7. 3 is connected to 4 and 7. 4 is connected to 7. But does 1 connect to 4? Let me check the edges. The edges for 1 are (0,1), (1,3), (1,5), (1,7). So 1 is not connected to 4. So in the group 0,1,3,4,7, 1 isn't connected to 4, so that's not a K5. How about 0,3,4,5,6? Let's see. 0 is connected to 3,4,6. 3 is connected to 4,5,6. 4 is connected to 5,6. 5 is connected to 6. But 0 isn't connected to 5. So that's missing edges. Hmm. Maybe another group. Let's check vertex 3. It's connected to 0,1,4,5,6,7. So, 3 is connected to six vertices. Let's take 3,0,1,4,5. 0 is connected to 1,3,4. 1 is connected to 3,5. 4 is connected to 3,5. 5 is connected to 3,4. But 0 isn't connected to 5, and 1 isn't connected to 4. So not a K5. Maybe another combination. How about 3,5,4,6,7. 3 is connected to 5,4,6,7. 5 is connected to 4,6. 4 is connected to 6,7. 6 is connected to 7. But 5 and 7 aren't connected. Let me check edges. The edge list says (5,6) is present, but is (5,7) present? Looking at the edges for 5: (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,6). So no, 5 is not connected to 7. So that's missing. So maybe there is no K5. How about K3,3? That's a bipartite graph with partitions of three nodes each, all edges between them. Let me see. Maybe check if there's a K3,3. For example, take vertices 0,1,2 and 3,4,5. Let's see if each of 0,1,2 connects to 3,4,5. 0 is connected to 3,4. Not to 5. 1 is connected to 3,5. Not to 4. 2 is connected to 5. So no, that's not K3,3. Another possible combination: 0,3,6 and 1,2,7. Let's see. 0 is connected to 1,2,3,4,6,7. So 0 connects to 1,2,3,7. 3 is connected to 1,4,5,6,7. 6 is connected to 0,2,3,4,5,7. Hmm, maybe not. Maybe another set. Let's take partitions A: 0,3,5 and B:1,2,4. Check if each in A is connected to each in B. 0 is connected to 1,2, but not to 4. So no. 3 is connected to 1,4. Not to 2. 5 is connected to 1,2,4. So maybe not. Hmm. Maybe not K3,3 either. So perhaps the graph is planar? If that's the case, then four colors would suffice. But maybe I should try to find a 4-coloring.

0 connected to all. Now check 1: 1 is connected to 0,3,5,6. But 1 is not connected to 5? Wait, vertex 1 is connected to 0,2,3,4,6,7. Wait, 1 is connected to 5? Wait, looking back at the edge list: (1,4) is present, (1,5) isn't. Wait, no, the edges for vertex 1 are (0,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,6), (1,7). So vertex 1 is not connected to 5. So 0,1,3,5,6: 1 and 5 are not connected. So that's not a K5.

Looking at the edges, vertex 0 is connected to almost everyone. Let's check: edges from 0 are to 1,2,3,4,5,6,7. So 0 is connected to all other 7 vertices. That means vertex 0 has degree 7. Then the other vertices: let's see. For example, vertex 1 is connected to 0,2,3,4. Vertex 2 is connected to 0,1,4,5,6,7. So vertex 2 has degree 6. Vertex 3 is connected to 0,1,5,6,7. Vertex 4 is connected to 0,1,2,5. Vertex 5 is connected to 0,2,3,4,6,7. Vertex 6 is connected to 0,2,3,5,7. Vertex 7 is connected to 0,2,3,5,6.

Alternatively, check if there's a K5 or K3,3. Let's see. For example, the vertices 1,2,3,5,7: 1 is connected to 2,3,5,7; 2 connected to 1,3,5,7; 3 connected to 1,2,5,7; 5 connected to 2,3,7; 7 connected to all. Not a K5 because 5 isn't connected to 1.

Wait, in the 4-clique assignment, vertex 6 is Yellow. So vertex 6: Yellow. Then, vertex 2 is connected to 6 (Yellow) and 0 (Green), so vertex 2 is Blue, which is okay. Now, vertex 7 is connected to 6 (Yellow) via edge (6,7)? Wait, in the original edges, vertex 6 is connected to 7: yes, edge (6,7) is present. So vertex 7 is connected to 6 (Yellow). So vertex 7's neighbors are 0 (Green), 1 (Blue), 3 (Green), 4 (Blue), 5 (Red), 6 (Yellow). Wait, but we assigned vertex 7 as Yellow, but it's connected to 6 (Yellow), which is the same color. That's a conflict. Oh no! So this coloring is invalid.

- Vertex 6 is connected to 0,1,2,3,4,5,7. Seven edges! That's connected to almost everyone except itself. Wait, except maybe vertex 4? Wait, vertex 6 is connected to 0,1,2,3,4,5,7. Let me check the edges again. The edges for 6 are: (0,6), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (7,6) according to the list. So yes, vertex 6 is connected to every other vertex except perhaps itself. Wait, no, it's connected to 0,1,2,3,4,5,7. That's all except vertex 6 isn't connected to itself. So vertex 6 has seven edges. That's the highest degree here. Similarly, vertex 5 has six edges.

Vertex 4: connected to 0,1,2,6,7. Can't be Red, Green (from 6), Yellow (from 7). So must be Blue. But vertex 4 is connected to vertex 5 (Blue), so can't be Blue. Contradiction. So vertex 4 can't be colored. Hmm.
