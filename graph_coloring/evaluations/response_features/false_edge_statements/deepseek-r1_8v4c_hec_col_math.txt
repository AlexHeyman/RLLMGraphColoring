Hmm, let me try to visualize this. Vertex 0 is connected to 3,4,5,6,7. So vertex 0 has degree 5. Vertex 1 is connected to 2,3,4,5,7. Also degree 5. Vertex 2 is connected to 1,5,6,7. Degree 4. Vertex 3 is connected to 0,1,4,5,6,7. Degree 6. That's a lot. Vertex 4 is connected to 0,1,3,6,7. Degree 5. Vertex 5 is connected to 0,1,2,3,6,7. Degree 6. Vertex 6 is connected to 0,2,3,4,5,7. Degree 6. Vertex 7 is connected to 0,1,2,3,4,5,6. Wait, is that right? Let's check: edges with 7 are (0,7), (1,7), (2,7), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7), (6,7). So yes, vertex 7 has degree 7. That's connected to every other vertex except maybe itself. Wait, no, in an undirected graph, edges are between different vertices. So vertex 7 is connected to all other 7 vertices. That's the highest degree here.

Looking at vertex 0 connected to 1,2,3,4,5,6. Let's see if any subset of those form a K5. For example, vertices 0,1,3,4,5: 0 is connected to all, 1 is connected to 3,4,5; 3 is connected to 1,4,5; 4 is connected to 1,3,5; 5 is connected to 1,3,4. So that's a K5? Because each of these five vertices (0,1,3,4,5) are all connected to each other. Wait, is 1 connected to 4? Yes. 1 is connected to 3,4,5. 3 is connected to 4 and 5. 4 is connected to 5. So in this subset, 0 is connected to everyone, and the others are connected to each other as well. So yes, that's a complete graph K5. Therefore, the graph is non-planar.

Starting with node 0. Let's color it Red. Now, node 0's neighbors (1,3,4,5,6,7) can't be Red. So we need to assign different colors to these. Let's look at node 1. Let's choose Green. Then node 1's neighbors (0,2,5,6) can't be Green. Node 2 is next. Let's color node 2. Since node 1 is Green, node 2 can't be Green. Also, node 2 is connected to 0 (Red), so can't be Red. So possible colors: Blue or Yellow. Let's choose Blue for node 2. Now, node 2's neighbors (1,3,4,5,6,7) can't be Blue. Node 3: connected to 0 (Red) and 2 (Blue). So possible colors: Green or Yellow. Let's pick Green. Wait, but node 3's neighbor is node 1 (Green)? Wait, node 3 is connected to 1? Let me check the edges. The edges for node 1: (0,1), (1,2), (1,5), (1,6). So no, node 3 is not connected to node 1. So node 3's neighbors are 0,2,4,6,7. So node 3 is connected to 0 (Red), 2 (Blue), and others. So node 3 can be Green or Yellow. Let's pick Green.

Hmm. Let me recall Kuratowski's theorem—a graph is planar if it doesn't contain a subgraph that is a complete graph K5 or K3,3. Let's see. Let's check if there's a K5 subgraph here. For example, vertex 2 is connected to everyone except maybe... wait, vertex 2 is connected to all except perhaps... no, vertex 2 is connected to all except maybe 5? Wait no, 2 is connected to 5. Wait, vertex 2 is connected to 0,1,3,4,5,6,7. So that's all except none. Wait, that's seven vertices. Wait, so vertex 2 is connected to every other vertex. Therefore, the graph contains a star with center at 2 and all other vertices connected to it. But a complete graph K8 would require every pair of vertices to be connected, which they aren't. But if vertex 2 is connected to all others, but the other vertices may not be connected to each other. For example, let's check if there's a K5 subgraph. Let's see: maybe vertices 0,1,2,3,4. Let's see if they form a K5. 0 is connected to 1,2,3,4. 1 is connected to 0,2,3, but not to 4. So 1-4 isn't an edge. So that's not a K5. How about vertices 2,0,1,3,7? Let's see. 2 is connected to all of them. 0 is connected to 1,2,3,7. 1 is connected to 0,2,3,7. 3 is connected to 0,1,2,7. 7 is connected to 0,1,2,3. Wait, but 0 and 7 are connected, 1 and 7, 2 and 7, etc. But in this subset, does every pair have an edge? Let's check 0 and 1: yes. 0 and 3: yes. 0 and 7: yes. 1 and 3: yes. 1 and 7: yes. 3 and 7: yes. 2 is connected to all. So in the subset {0,1,2,3,7}, every pair except maybe 0-3? Wait, no, 0 is connected to 3. So all pairs in this subset are connected except maybe 0-1-3-7 and 2. Wait, no. Wait, in this subset, 0,1,2,3,7. Each of these nodes is connected to each other. For example, 0-1, 0-2, 0-3, 0-7. 1-2, 1-3, 1-7. 2-3, 2-7. 3-7. Wait, but 0 and 3 are connected, so in this subset, every pair is connected. So this subset {0,1,2,3,7} forms a K5. Because each node is connected to every other node. Let's verify:

Then vertex 2. Vertex 2 is connected to 1 (Green), so can't be Green. Also, vertex 2 is connected to 3,4,5 (all Yellow). So vertex 2 can't be Yellow. So vertex 2 must be Blue. But vertex 2 is connected to 7 (Blue). Wait, 7 is Blue, so vertex 2 can't be Blue. So this is a problem. Because vertex 2 can't be Green or Yellow or Blue? Wait, no. The available colors are Green, Blue, Yellow, but 2 can't be Green (adjacent to 1), can't be Yellow (adjacent to 3,4,5), can't be Blue (adjacent to 7). That's a conflict.

For example, vertices 0,3,5,7: are they all connected to each other? 0 is connected to 3,5,7. 3 is connected to 5 and 7. 5 is connected to 7. So yes, that's a clique of size 4.

Wait, but each of those 7 vertices can only conflict with vertex 6. But each of those 7 vertices can have colors from the remaining three colors. But maybe that's possible. Wait, but maybe the graph is a complete graph on 8 vertices? No, because not all possible edges are present. For example, vertex 2 is not connected to 7? Let me check the edges again. The edges for vertex 2: 1,3,4,5,6. So 2 is not connected to 7. So vertex 6 is connected to everyone, but others are not. So vertex 6 is a universal vertex. So in the coloring, vertex 6 must have a unique color not shared by any of the other vertices. Since we have four colors, the other seven vertices can use the remaining three colors. Wait, but if vertex 6 is colored, say, Red, then all other vertices must be Green, Blue, or Yellow. But the problem is that the subgraph induced by the other vertices (0-5,7) might not be 3-colorable. Wait, but we have four colors. Wait, the four-color theorem says that any planar graph can be colored with four colors, but I don't know if this graph is planar. Wait, but maybe the graph is not planar.

Wait, no, let's count again for 5: edges are (0,5), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,6), (5,7). So that's seven edges. So vertex 5 has degree 7. Vertex 6 is connected to 0,2,3,4,5,7—six edges. Vertex 7 is connected to 0,1,2,4,5,6—six edges.

Looking at the edges, vertex 0 is connected to 1, 2, 5, 6, 7. That's quite a lot. Then vertex 1 is connected to 0, 2, 4, 5, 7. Vertex 2 is connected to 0,1,3,4,5,6,7.

So yes, vertex 7 is connected to all others except 3? Wait no, 3 is connected to 7 via (3,7). So vertex 7 is connected to all other vertices. That means vertex 7 has degree 7, which is the highest. Similarly, vertex 2 is connected to 0,1,3,4,5,6,7—so that's 7 edges too. Wait, but 2 is connected to 3 and 7, which 7 is connected to everyone. Hmm.

Looking for the largest complete subgraph. Let's check vertex 0's neighbors: 1,4,5,6,7. Are any of these forming a clique? 1 is connected to 4,5,6. 4 is connected to 5,6,7. 5 is connected to 4,6,7. 6 is connected to 4,5,7. 7 is connected to 4,5,6. Wait, so among 4,5,6,7: each is connected to the others? Let's check. 4-5: yes. 4-6: yes. 4-7: yes. 5-6: yes. 5-7: yes. 6-7: yes. So 4,5,6,7 form a complete subgraph K4. So there's a clique of size 4. Therefore, the chromatic number is at least 4. Since we have four colors, it's possible that it's exactly 4. But since there's a K4, that means we need at least 4 colors, and since the question allows 4, maybe it's possible.

Wait, but in the edge list, (5,6) is present, and (7,6) would be same as (6,7). Looking back: edges include (0,6), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (0,7), (1,7), (2,7), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7). So vertex 6 is connected to 0,1,2,3,4,5,7. That's all except itself, but since it's a simple graph, no loops. So vertex 6 is connected to all other vertices except itself. Similarly, vertex 7 is connected to 0,1,2,3,4,5,6. So 7 is also connected to everyone except itself. So 6 and 7 are each connected to all other vertices. Wait, but 6 and 7 are connected to each other as well. So that's a complete graph between 6 and 7? Wait, no, 6 and 7 are connected via edge (6,7), which is in the list. So 6 and 7 are adjacent.

Looking at the edges, let's see if any five vertices are all connected to each other. For instance, vertex 5 is connected to all others except none, since it's connected to 0,1,2,3,4,6,7.

Let me count again. The edges involving 6: (0,6), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (4,7), (5,6). Wait, wait, the edge list given is:

Alternatively, perhaps the entire graph is 4-colorable. Since the four-color theorem states that any planar graph can be colored with four colors. Wait, but is this graph planar? Wait, the four-color theorem applies to planar graphs, but if the graph is non-planar, then it might require more colors. But in this case, the question allows four colors, so maybe it's possible regardless. Wait, but the four-color theorem is about planar graphs. However, this graph might not be planar. Let's check if it's planar. For a graph to be planar, it must satisfy Kuratowski's theorem, i.e., not contain a subgraph that is a complete graph K5 or K3,3. Let's see. The original graph has vertex 6 connected to all others, so the graph contains a K8? No, but a complete graph on 8 vertices would have all possible edges, which it's not. But the presence of a K5 subgraph? Let's check. For example, vertices 0,1,2,3,4: are they all connected to each other? Let's see. 0 is connected to 1,3,4. 1 is connected to 2,4. 2 is connected to 3,4. 3 is connected to 4. So in this subset, it's not a complete graph. How about another subset. Let's check vertices 0,1,4,5,6. 0 connected to 1,4,5,6. 1 connected to 0,4,5,6. 4 connected to 0,1,5,6. 5 connected to 0,1,4,6. 6 connected to all. So in this subset, excluding 6, maybe. Wait, but 0,1,4,5,6: 0-1, 0-4, 0-5, 0-6; 1-4,1-5,1-6; 4-5,4-6; 5-6. So the subgraph induced by 0,1,4,5,6 is almost a complete graph, except maybe 4 and 5 are connected? Wait, in the original edge list, (4,5) is not present. Wait, checking the edge list: (0,5) is there, (1,5) is there, (2,5), (3,5), (4,5) is not in the edge list. Wait, let's check again. The edges are:

Vertex 5 is connected to 7. So vertex 7 can't be Blue. Also, can't be Red. So vertex 7 must be Green or Yellow. But vertex 7 is connected to 0 (Green), so can't be Green. Therefore, vertex 7 must be Yellow.

First, let's note the edges. Vertex 0 is connected to 1,2,3,4,5,7. That's six edges. So vertex 0 has degree 6. Then vertex 1 is connected to 0,3,4,5,6,7. Wait, so vertex 1 has edges to 0 and others: 3,4,5,6,7. That's 6 edges as well. Then vertex 2 is connected to 0,3,4,5,6,7. Also 6 edges. So vertices 0,1,2 each have degree 6.

First, let's list all the edges. Vertex 0 is connected to 1, 4, 6, 7. That's four edges. Then vertex 1 is connected to 0, 2, 3, 7. So degree 4 as well. Vertex 2 has a lot of connections: 1,3,4,5,6,7. That's six edges. Vertex 3 is connected to 1,2,5,6,7. Five edges. Vertex 4 is connected to 0,2,5,6,7. Five edges. Vertex 5 is connected to 2,3,4,6,7. Five edges. Vertex 6 is connected to 0,2,3,4,5,7. Six edges. Vertex 7 is connected to 0,1,2,3,4,5,6. Wow, that's seven edges—vertex 7 is connected to every other vertex except itself. Wait, no, the edges listed for 7 are (0,7), (1,7), (2,7), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7), (6,7). So yes, vertex 7 is connected to all others except maybe itself. So vertex 7 has degree 7. That's going to be a key point because it's connected to all other vertices except none. Wait, no, in an undirected graph, loops aren't allowed, so each edge is between two distinct vertices. So vertex 7 is connected to 0,1,2,3,4,5,6. So seven edges. So that's the highest degree vertex. Since we have four colors, and vertex 7 is connected to seven others, but there are only four colors. So each neighbor of vertex 7 must take a different color than vertex 7. But since vertex 7 is connected to all others, all the other seven vertices must be colored differently from vertex 7. Wait, but we have four colors. So if vertex 7 is colored, say, Red, then all other vertices (0-6) must be Green, Blue, or Yellow. But there are seven vertices, so by the pigeonhole principle, some colors will have to be reused. But since the graph is undirected and adjacent vertices can't share the same color, the problem is whether the remaining graph (excluding vertex 7) is 3-colorable. Because if we remove vertex 7, the remaining graph (vertices 0-6) must be colored with three colors such that adjacent vertices have different colors. Then we can color vertex 7 with the fourth color. But wait, but maybe that's not the case. Let me check. Because when you remove vertex 7, the graph might not be 3-colorable. So if the remaining graph is 3-colorable, then the original graph is 4-colorable. So the key question is: is the subgraph induced by vertices 0-6 3-colorable?

Vertex 5: adjacent to 0 (Green), 1 (Red), 2 (Blue), 3 (Yellow), 4 (Green), 7. So 5 can't be Green, Red, Blue, or Yellow. Wait, that's a problem. All four colors are used by its neighbors. So that's a conflict. So this coloring attempt fails here.

Alternative approach: Let's start with vertex 2 again. Assign Red. Then vertex 4, which is connected to 2. Let's try assigning Blue instead of Green. Then vertex 5 is connected to 2 (Red) and 4 (Blue). So possible colors: Green or Yellow. Let's pick Green for 5.
