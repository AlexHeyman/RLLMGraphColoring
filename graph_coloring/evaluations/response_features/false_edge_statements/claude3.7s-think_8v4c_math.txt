Here's an attempt at a proof we need 5 colors. If we color 7 as color 1, we need to color its immediate neighbors with different colors. Neighbors of 7 are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6. So we need at least min(7-1, 6) = 6 more colors. We could try to reuse colors: Let's color 0 as color 2, 1 as color 3, 2 as color 4, 3 as color 5, 4 as color 6, 6 as color 7. Now we're adding vertex 5, which is connected to 0 (color 2), 3 (color 5), and 6 (color 7). The cheapest way to color 5 is to reuse color 1. If I just look at the subset of vertices 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, we definitely need 6 colors. And if we just look at vertices 7, 2, 3, 4, 6 and consider that 7 is connected to all of the other 4, and 2 connected to 3, 4, and 6, and 4 connected to 3 and 6, and 3 connected to 6. They don't form a 5-clique, but there are 9 edges among 5 vertices (out of a maximum of 10 edges), which means it's almost a 5-clique. It's not conclusive that we need 5 colors, but it's definitely plausible.

I have vertex 0 as Red, vertex 7 as Red, vertex 6 as Green, vertex 2 as Blue, and vertex 1 as Yellow. Vertex 3 is adjacent to vertex 2, and they can't have the same color (which is Blue). So, vertex 3 can't be Blue. It's adjcent to vertices 0 (Red), 1 (Yellow), 6 (Green), and 7 (Red). Since vertices 0 and 7 are both Red, vertex 3 can't be Red.
