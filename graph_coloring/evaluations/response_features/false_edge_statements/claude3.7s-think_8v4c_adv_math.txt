Let's step back and think about this graph more intuitively. The key issue we're having is that the dense structure of the graph makes it hard to color with just 4 colors. The missing edges among vertices 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 are (0, 2) and (1, 5). This means that 0 and 2 can be the same color, and 1 and 5 can be the same color. But other than that, no two vertices in this set can have the same color. So, we've essentially reduced to coloring 5 vertices (where 0 and 2 are treated as one vertex, and 1 and 5 are treated as one vertex). Coloring 5 distinct vertices with no edges in between requires 5 colors. So, it starts to look like this graph can't be colored with just 4 colors.
