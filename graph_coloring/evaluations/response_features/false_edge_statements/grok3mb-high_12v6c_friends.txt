From the text: Alice is friends with Irene, Bob with Irene, Carol with Irene, Dave with Irene, Ethan with Irene, Fran with Irene, George with Irene, Heather with Irene, Irene with Jack, Irene with Kathy, Irene with Larry. Irene is listed as friends with Jack, Kathy, Larry, but from others, it's mutual, I assume friendships are undirected.
