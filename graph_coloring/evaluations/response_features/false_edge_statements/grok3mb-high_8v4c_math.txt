Color vertex 1: red, vertex 2: green, vertex 3: blue, vertex 4: green, but vertex 4 green and vertex 5 must be different from 4 and 1, vertex 1 is red, vertex 4 is green, so vertex 5 cannot be green or red, so must be blue, but vertex 3 is blue and not adjacent to 5? In C5, 3 and 5 are not adjacent, so ok: 1:red, 2:green, 3:blue, 4:green, 5:blue. 4 is green, 5 is blue, adjacent ok; 5 blue and 1 red, adjacent ok. But 2 and 4 both green, but not adjacent, since in C5, 2 adjacent to 1 and 3, 4 adjacent to 3 and 5, so no edge between 2 and 4, so same color ok.
