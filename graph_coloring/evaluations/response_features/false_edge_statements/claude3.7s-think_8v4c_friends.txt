6. Ethan (E): Friends with George, Alice, Bob, and Carol. He can't use colors 1, 2, or 3. So he gets color 4 (Yellow, same as Dave). But Ethan is friends with Dave, so this doesn't work.

Wait, now Ethan and Dave are both Blue, but they might be friends. Let me check... Yes, I missed that Ethan is friends with Dave. So Ethan can't be Blue. Let me restart.

But now we have a problem. Bob and Ethan both have Blue, and they are friends with Heather. So Heather can't be Blue. Similarly, Alice and Dave both have Green, and they are friends with Heather. So Heather can't be Green either. And George has Yellow, and George is friends with Heather. So Heather can't be Yellow. But Heather also can't be Red because she's friends with Fran. So there's no available color for Heather.
