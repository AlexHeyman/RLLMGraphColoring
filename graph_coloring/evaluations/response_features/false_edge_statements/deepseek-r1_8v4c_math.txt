Node 0 is connected to 1,2,3,4,5. So in the subgraph induced by 0,1,2,3,4,5, node 0 is connected to all others. Now, check if 1 is connected to 2,3,4,5. Yes. 1 is connected to 2,3,4,5. Similarly, 2 is connected to 1,3,4,5. 3 is connected to 1,2,4,5. 4 is connected to 1,2,3,5. 5 is connected to 0,1,2,3,4. So in this subgraph, nodes 1,2,3,4,5 form a complete graph K5? Let's check.

Alternatively, maybe the graph contains a complete graph of 5 nodes (K5), which would require 5 colors. Let me check. A K5 subgraph would need 5 nodes each connected to every other. Let's see. Looking at node 0: connected to 1,3,5,6,7. So 5 edges. If any of these 5 nodes (0,1,3,5,6,7) form a K5? Let's check. For example, check if node 0 is connected to 1,3,5,6,7. Then check if 1 is connected to 3,5,6,7. Yes, 1 is connected to 3,5,6,7. So 0 and 1 share connections to 3,5,6,7. So the nodes 0,1,3,5,6,7. Wait, let's check if 0,1,3,5,6 form a K5. 0 is connected to all. 1 is connected to all others except maybe 5? No, 1 is connected to 5. 3 is connected to 0,1,5,6. Wait, 3 is connected to 0,1,2,4,5,6,7. So 3 is connected to 0,1,5,6. So in the group 0,1,3,5,6: each node is connected to the others? Let's check:

To check planarity, one way is to use Kuratowski's theorem, which says a graph is non-planar if it contains a subgraph that is a complete graph K5 or a complete bipartite graph K3,3. Let me see if there's a K5 here. Let's check the neighbors of vertex 1: connected to 0,2,3,4,5,6,7. So, vertex 1 is connected to seven others. Let's see if any five of them form a complete subgraph. For example, take vertices 0,2,3,4,5. Are they all connected to each other? 0 is connected to 1,3,5,6,7. 0 is connected to 3 and 5 here. 0 is not connected to 2 or 4. So between 0,2,3,4,5: 0 is connected to 3 and 5. 2 is connected to 1,3,6,7. So 2 is connected to 3 here, but 2 is not connected to 4 or 5. So 0,2,3,4,5 don't form a K5. What about 1,3,5,7? Let's check if they form a complete subgraph. 1 is connected to 3,5,7. 3 is connected to 5 and 7 (from edges (3,5) and (3,7)? Wait the edges given for 3 are (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6). So 3 is connected to 5, but not to 7. Wait, is there an edge (3,7)? The edge list includes (0,7), (1,7), (2,7), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,7), (5,7), (6,7). So 3 is connected to 0,1,2,4,5,6. Not to 7. Therefore, 3 is not connected to 7. So 1,3,5,7: 1 is connected to all, but 3 isn't connected to 7, so that's not a complete subgraph. Similarly, checking for K3,3. Let's see if there's a bipartition of two sets of three vertices each, all connected.

Is there a clique of size 4 in the original graph? Let's check. For example, vertices 0,3,6,7: 0 is connected to 3,6,7. 3 is connected to 0,6,7. 6 is connected to 0,3,7. 7 is connected to 0,3,6. So yes, that's a complete subgraph K4 (clique of size 4). Therefore, since there's a K4, we need at least 4 colors. Since we have four colors, it's possible, but we need to ensure that the rest can be colored appropriately.

For example, vertex 0 is connected to 1,3,5,6,7. So after coloring vertex 1, say Red, then vertices 0,3,5,6,7 must be colored with Green, Blue, or Yellow. But also, vertex 0 is connected to 3,5,6,7. So those vertices (3,5,6,7) are all adjacent to 0, so they can't be the same color as 0. But since 0 is colored with a color different from Red (vertex 1's color), say Green. Then 3,5,6,7 must be Blue or Yellow. However, vertices 3,5,6,7 are connected among themselves. For example, 3 is connected to 5,6,7. So they can't share the same color. So this seems complicated. Maybe it's better to approach this step by step.

Looking for a bipartite K3,3. Let's see if there's a subset of 6 nodes divided into two sets of 3 with all edges between them. For example, let's see: vertices 0 is connected to 1,2,3,4,5,6. Suppose one partition is {0}, but that's not three. Alternatively, perhaps {0,1,3} and {2,4,5}. Wait, check edges between these. 0 is connected to 2,4,5 (yes, 0-2, 0-4, 0-5). 1 is connected to 2,4,5 (1-2,1-4,1-5). 3 is connected to 2 (yes), 4 (no, 3-4 not in edge list), 5 (yes). So 3 is connected to 2 and 5, but not 4. So that's not a complete bipartition. Therefore, no K3,3 here. So maybe Kuratowski's theorem isn't applicable here, but the graph is non-planar because of the edge count. So maybe it's a different non-planar graph. Anyway, regardless of planarity, the question is whether it's 4-colorable.

Looking at vertex 3: it's connected to 0,1,2,4,5,6,7. Let's check if any subset of five vertices form a complete subgraph. For example, vertices 3,4,5,6,7. Let's see: 3 is connected to 4,5,6,7. 4 is connected to 5,6,7. 5 is connected to 6. 6 is connected to 7. Wait, 5 and 7 are not connected. So 3,4,5,6,7: 3-4, 3-5, 3-6, 3-7; 4-5, 4-6, 4-7; 5-6; 6-7. So that's not a complete graph. How about 3,4,5,0,2? Let's see. 3 is connected to 0,4,5,2. 0 is connected to 3,4,5,6,7. But 0 and 2 aren't connected. So that's not a complete graph. Maybe another group. How about 0,3,4,5,6? 0 is connected to 3,4,5,6. 3 is connected to 4,5,6. 4 is connected to 5,6. 5 is connected to 6. But 0 isn't connected to 4,5,6 through edges—wait, actually, 0 is connected to 3,4,5,6. So in this subset, 0 is connected to 3,4,5,6. 3 is connected to everyone else. But 4 is connected to 0,3,5,6. However, 0 and 5: yes, edge exists. 0 and 6: yes. So 0-3-4-5-6: maybe not a complete graph. For instance, 0 is not connected to 5 directly? Wait, yes, 0 is connected to 5. So 0,3,4,5,6: 0 is connected to 3,4,5,6. 3 is connected to 4,5,6. 4 is connected to 5,6. 5 is connected to 6. But in this subset, is every pair connected? Let's check all pairs:

Hmm, looking at these edges, I notice that vertex 0 is connected to 1,4,5,6,7. So vertex 0 has degree 5. Similarly, vertex 1 is connected to 0,3,4,5,6,7—so degree 6. Vertex 2 is connected to 3,4,5,6,7—degree 5. Vertex 3 is connected to 1,2,4,5,7—degree 5. Vertex 4 is connected to 0,1,2,3,5,7—degree 6. Vertex 5 is connected to 0,1,2,3,4,6—degree 6. Vertex 6 is connected to 0,1,2,5,7—degree 5. Vertex 7 is connected to 0,1,2,3,4,5,6—degree 7. Wait, vertex 7 is connected to all except maybe itself? Let me check: edges for 7 are (0,7), (1,7), (2,7), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7), (6,7). So seven edges, so degree 7. That's a high degree. So vertex 7 is connected to every other vertex except maybe itself. Wait, but in an undirected graph, nodes can't connect to themselves. So yes, vertex 7 is connected to all others except perhaps vertex 2? Wait no, vertex 2 is connected to 7 as per the edge list. Wait, looking at edges for 2: (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7). So yes, 2 is connected to 7. So vertex 7 is connected to 0,1,2,3,4,5,6—all except itself. So vertex 7 has seven edges. That means when coloring, vertex 7 must have a different color from all seven of its neighbors. But since there are only four colors, but seven neighbors, but that's okay because the neighbors can share colors as long as they are not adjacent. Wait, but the problem is that vertex 7 is adjacent to all other vertices except maybe none. Wait, all 7 other vertices. So vertex 7 is adjacent to every other vertex, which are 0 through 6. Therefore, all other seven nodes are connected to 7. So when assigning a color to vertex 7, we need to choose a color that is not used by any of the other seven vertices. But since there are four colors, and seven other vertices, by the pigeonhole principle, at least two of those seven must share the same color. But since they are all adjacent to 7, their colors don't affect 7's color. Wait, but each of those seven can be colored with four colors, but vertex 7 needs a color different from all of them. But since there are seven nodes each connected to 7, each of those seven must have a different color from 7. However, the four colors mean that 7 can't use any color used by any of those seven. But since there are four colors, but seven neighbors, how can this work? Wait, hold on. Wait, the four colors are available for all vertices, but each neighbor of 7 must have a color different from 7. So if 7 is colored, say, red, then all of 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 must be colored green, blue, or yellow. But there are seven nodes and only three colors allowed for them. By the pigeonhole principle, at least two of these nodes would have the same color. But if those two nodes are adjacent, that would be a problem. So the key is whether the subgraph induced by vertices 0-6 can be colored with three colors such that adjacent nodes don't share the same color. If that's possible, then vertex 7 can take the fourth color. If not, then it's impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps the subgraph (vertices 1-7) has a chromatic number higher than 3. Let's check if there's a clique of size 4.

Wait, 1 connected to 3,5,7. 3 connected to 1,5,7. 5 connected to 1,3,7. 7 connected to 1,3,5. But in a complete graph of 4 nodes, every node is connected to every other.

So if there's a 4-clique in the subgraph, then that subgraph would require 4 colors.

Wait, let's check if there's a clique of size 4. For example, vertices 2,3,6,7. Let's see: 2 is connected to 3,6,7. 3 is connected to 2,6,7. 6 is connected to 2,3, and 7. 7 is connected to 2,3,6. So yes, that's a clique of size 4. Because each is connected to the others. Similarly, vertices 2,3,5,6: 2 connected to 3,5,6; 3 connected to 2,5,6; 5 connected to 2,3,6; 6 connected to 2,3,5. Wait, but 5 and 6 are connected (since there's an edge (5,6)), so that's a clique of size 4. Similarly, 2,3,5,7: 2 connected to 3,5,7; 3 connected to 2,5,7; 5 connected to 2,3,7 (wait, edge (5,7) is present? Let's check. The edges for 5 are (0,5), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (5,6). So 5 is connected to 0,1,2,3,6. So 5 is not connected to 7. So the edge (5,7) is not present. Therefore, the clique 2,3,5,7 would not be a clique because 5 and 7 are not connected. So the actual cliques of size 4 would be 2,3,6,7 since all edges are present. Similarly, 2,3,4,6? Let's check: 2 connected to 3,4,6; 3 connected to 2,4,6; 4 connected to 2,3,6 (edge (4,6) is present); 6 connected to 2,3,4. But wait, 4 and 3 are connected, 4 and 2 are connected, etc. But does 4 connect to 7? Yes, (4,7) is present. So maybe 2,3,4,6,7? Wait, but if there's a clique of size 5, that's a problem because coloring a clique of size n requires n colors.

Looking at the edges, vertex 0 is connected to 2,5,6,7. But 7 is out of the picture here. So in the subgraph of 0-6, vertex 0 is connected to 2,5,6. Vertex 1 is connected to 2,3,6. Vertex 2 is connected to 0,1,3,4,5. Vertex 3 is connected to 1,2,4,5,6. Vertex 4 is connected to 2,3,5,6. Vertex 5 is connected to 0,2,3,4,6. Vertex 6 is connected to 0,1,3,4,5. So this is a pretty dense graph. Let me see if there's a complete graph here. For example, vertex 0 is connected to 2,5,6. But not to 1,3,4. So not a complete graph. But maybe some of the other vertices form a complete subgraph. For example, check if vertices 2,3,5,6 form a complete subgraph. Vertex 2 is connected to 3,5,6 (yes). Vertex 3 is connected to 5 and 6 (yes). Vertex 5 is connected to 6. Wait, but does each pair connect? 2-3, 2-5, 2-6, 3-5, 3-6, 5-6. So yes, that's a complete subgraph K4. So 2,3,5,6 form a complete graph of four nodes. Therefore, each of these four nodes must have different colors. So in this subgraph, each requires a unique color. Since we have four colors, that's possible. But vertex 7 is adjacent to all of them, so vertex 7's color must be different from all four. Wait, but we only have four colors in total. So if 2,3,5,6 each take a different color, and vertex 7 is adjacent to all of them, then vertex 7 would need a fifth color, which we don't have. Therefore, this seems like a problem.

Since the problem allows four colors and the graph is undirected, I need to check if the graph is 4-colorable. The four-color theorem states that any planar graph is 4-colorable, but I don't know if this graph is planar. Wait, but maybe the graph isn't planar. Let me think. Planar graphs can be drawn without edge crossings. But with vertex 7 connected to all others except one (but wait, vertex 7 is connected to 0,1,2,3,4,5,6. So all except vertex 7 itself. Wait, no, vertex 7 is connected to all other 7 vertices. So in a complete graph K8, which is not planar. But this isn't K8, but vertex 7 is connected to 7 other vertices, but the other vertices may not be connected to each other. However, the presence of a K5 subgraph would make it non-planar. Let me check if there's a K5 here. For example, vertices 0,2,5,6,7: are they all connected to each other? Let's see: 0 is connected to 2,5,6,7. 2 is connected to 0,5,6,7. 5 is connected to 0,2,6,7. 6 is connected to 0,2,5,7. 7 is connected to all of them. So this is a K5, right? Because 0,2,5,6,7 are all interconnected. Therefore, since K5 is non-planar, the graph is non-planar. But the four-color theorem applies only to planar graphs. However, the question isn't about whether it's planar but whether it can be colored with four colors. So even if it's non-planar, maybe it's still 4-colorable. So the four-color theorem doesn't help here. But maybe the graph's structure allows for a 4-coloring.

Wow, vertex 7 is connected to every other vertex except maybe itself. Wait, the graph is undirected, so vertex 7 is connected to 0,1,2,3,4,5,6. So degree 7. That's a high degree. So vertex 7 is adjacent to all others except itself. Wait, but in the edge list given, for 7: (0,7), (1,7), (2,7), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7), (6,7). So yes, 7 edges. So vertex 7 is connected to all other 7 vertices. So in terms of coloring, vertex 7 will need a different color from all others. But since there are four colors, as long as the other seven vertices use up at most three colors, then vertex 7 can take the fourth. But since vertex 7 is connected to everyone, all the other vertices must be colored with the remaining three colors. Wait, but the problem allows four colors. Wait, no. Wait, no. The total colors available are four, so each adjacent vertex to 7 must be a different color than 7. So vertex 7 will take one color, say color A, and all other vertices (0-6) must be colored with B, C, D. Wait, but since each of them is adjacent to 7, they can't be A. But they can be any of the other three. Wait, but if we have four colors total, then maybe vertex 7 can be color 4, and the others can use 1,2,3,4 except that they can't be 4. Wait, no. Wait, the problem states that each vertex is colored red, green, blue, or yellow. So four colors. So if vertex 7 is colored, say, red, then all the other vertices (0-6) must be green, blue, or yellow. But each of those vertices (0-6) is adjacent to 7, so they can't be red. So effectively, the remaining graph (vertices 0-6 and edges excluding those connected to 7) must be 3-colorable? Because they can only use three colors. Wait, but the problem allows four colors. Wait, no. The problem allows four colors, but vertex 7 is taking one of them. The rest can use the remaining three, but since they can't be the same as 7's color. So the question is: is the subgraph induced by vertices 0-6 3-colorable? Because if that's possible, then vertex 7 can take the fourth color. If the subgraph 0-6 is 3-colorable, then the whole graph is 4-colorable. If the subgraph 0-6 is not 3-colorable, then the entire graph is not 4-colorable. Wait, but maybe the original graph is 4-colorable even if the subgraph isn't 3-colorable, because in the original problem, we can use all four colors for the entire graph, but vertex 7 just can't use the same as its neighbors. Wait, but in this case, since all neighbors of 7 are 0-6, and vertex 7 is connected to all of them. So if vertex 7 is color 4, then all others (0-6) must be 1,2,3. So the problem reduces to 3-coloring the subgraph of 0-6 with edges that are present in the original graph, excluding those connected to 7. Wait, but in the original graph's edges, the edges between 0-6 are still present. Let me check the original edge list for edges not involving 7. Let's see:

Check for K5. Let's see if there's a set of five vertices all connected to each other. For example, vertices 0,1,2,5,7. Wait, 7 is connected to all, but 0 is connected to 1,2,3,5,7. Let's see if there's a K5. For example, vertices 1,5,6,7, maybe? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe vertices 1,5,2,6,7. But 7 is connected to all. But K5 requires that every pair is connected. Let's check if, say, vertices 1,2,5,6,7 form a K5. 1 is connected to 2,5,6,7. 2 is connected to 1,5,6,7. 5 is connected to 1,2,6,7. 6 is connected to 1,2,5,7. 7 is connected to all. So yes, these five vertices form a K5, because each is connected to the others. For example, 1 and 2 are connected, 1 and 5, 1 and 6, etc. So yes, this is a K5 subgraph. Therefore, the graph is non-planar. But the four-color theorem applies to planar graphs, but since this graph is non-planar, it might still be 4-colorable, but it's possible that it requires more colors. Wait, but any graph can be colored with at most Δ + 1 colors, where Δ is the maximum degree. Here, vertex 7 has degree 7, so Δ is 7, so 8 colors might be needed. But that's just an upper bound. But maybe it's possible with fewer. However, the problem asks if it's possible with four colors. Since we found a K5 subgraph, which is a complete graph of five nodes, which requires five colors. Wait, a complete graph of n nodes requires n colors. Therefore, since there's a K5, the chromatic number is at least 5. Therefore, the graph cannot be colored with four colors. Therefore, the answer should be "Impossible".

Since it's connected to every other vertex except maybe itself. Wait, no, in the list given, vertex 7 has edges to 0,1,2,3,4,5,6. Yes, all except vertex 7 itself. So vertex 7 is adjacent to every other node. That's important because in the coloring, vertex 7 will need a color different from all other vertices. But since there are 7 adjacent vertices, but we have four colors. Wait, but the four-color theorem states that any planar graph can be colored with four colors. But first, is this graph planar? Wait, maybe I should check if the graph is planar or not. Because if it's planar, then four colors should suffice. But if it's not planar, then maybe it's not 4-colorable. Wait, but the four-color theorem applies to planar graphs. If the graph is non-planar, it might require more colors. However, in this case, the question allows four colors. Wait, the problem states that we can use four colors. So maybe even if the graph is non-planar, perhaps it can still be colored with four colors. But how do we check?

Wait, but vertex 4 is connected to vertex 3 (Yellow). Wait, vertex 3 is Yellow, so if we assign Yellow to vertex 4, that's a conflict because vertices 3 and 4 are connected. Wait, yes! Wait, in the edge list, (3,4) is not present? Let me check the edges again. The edges for vertex 3: (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (3,6), (3,7). So vertex 3 is connected to 0,1,2,6,7. Not to 4. So vertex 3 and 4 are not connected. Therefore, vertex 4 can be Yellow even if vertex 3 is Yellow. Because they are not adjacent. Okay, so vertex 4 can be Yellow.

Kuratowski's theorem says a graph is non-planar if it contains a subgraph that is a complete graph K5 or a complete bipartite graph K3,3. Let's see. Let's look for K5.

No, it's not a complete graph. So maybe this subgraph is 3-colorable? Wait, but we have to use two colors (since they can't be red or blue if we start with 0 as red and 4 as green, for example). Wait, but in the previous attempts, we tried to color this subgraph with two colors and failed. Maybe this subgraph is not bipartite, hence not 2-colorable. Let's check if it contains any odd-length cycles. For example, let's take node1 connected to node2, node2 connected to node5, node5 connected to node7, node7 connected to node1. That's a cycle 1-2-5-7-1. Length 4, even. Not a problem. Another cycle: 1-3-7-5-2-1. That's length 5, which is odd. So if there's an odd-length cycle, the subgraph is not bipartite, hence not 2-colorable. Therefore, if we need to color this subgraph with two colors, it's impossible. Hence, the initial approach of assigning 0 as red and 4 as green (or any two different colors) may not work because the remaining subgraph needs more than two colors. But since the overall problem allows four colors, maybe there's a way to use more colors for the subgraph. Wait, but in the initial setup, when we assign two colors to 0 and 4, the remaining nodes must use the other two colors. But if the subgraph requires three colors, then it's impossible. So perhaps the problem is that the subgraph requires three colors, but we only have two available (since they can't take the colors of 0 and 4), making it impossible. Therefore, maybe the graph is not 4-colorable. Wait, but the four-color theorem says that any planar graph is 4-colorable. But is this graph planar? Let's check. If the graph contains K5 or K3,3 as a minor, then it's non-planar. Let's see: vertices0 is connected to all others. So if we take 0,1,2,3,4, that's a K5? Let's see. 0 is connected to 1,2,3,4. 1 is connected to 2,3,4. 2 is connected to 1,3,4. 3 is connected to 1,2,4. 4 is connected to 0,1,2,3. So that's a K5 between 0,1,2,3,4. Because each is connected to every other. For example, 0-1-2-3-4-0, but wait, does 1 connect to 4? Yes, edge (1,4). 2 connects to 4, yes. 3 connects to 4, yes. So the subgraph induced by 0,1,2,3,4 is a complete graph K5. Therefore, the graph contains K5 as a subgraph, which makes it non-planar. The four-color theorem applies to planar graphs, but non-planar graphs can require more colors. Wait, but K5 is not 4-colorable. Wait, K5 requires 5 colors because each node is connected to every other. So if the graph contains a K5, it would require 5 colors, but we only have 4. Therefore, this graph is not 4-colorable. Hence, it's impossible to color it with four colors as required.

But wait, maybe there's a mistake here. Let me try to color it manually, just to confirm. Let's attempt to assign colors to each node, starting from node 0. Suppose node 0 is red. Then its neighbors (1,3,4,5,6) can't be red. Let's assign node 1 green. Then node 1's neighbors (0,2,3,4,6,7) can't be green. Node 2 is adjacent to 1, which is green, so it can be red, blue, or yellow. Let's say blue. Then node 3, adjacent to 0 (red) and 1 (green), so possible blue or yellow. But node 3 is also adjacent to 2 (blue), so can't be blue. So yellow. Then node 4, adjacent to 0 (red), 1 (green). So possible blue or yellow. Node 4 is also adjacent to 2 (blue), so can't be blue. So yellow. But node 4 is connected to node 3 (yellow). So conflict. So node 4 can't be yellow. Therefore, this path doesn't work. Let's backtrack. Maybe node 3 can be blue instead. Wait, node 3 is adjacent to 0 (red) and 1 (green). So blue or yellow. If node 3 is blue, then node 4 adjacent to 0 (red), 1 (green), and 3 (blue). So possible yellow. Then node 4 is yellow. Now node 2 is blue, adjacent to 4 (yellow), which is okay. Then node 5 is adjacent to 0 (red), 2 (blue), 6,7. Let's assign node 5. It can't be red or blue. Let's say green. Then node 6 is adjacent to 0 (red), 1 (green), 3 (blue), 4 (yellow), 5 (green), 7. So node 6 can't be red, green, blue, or yellow. Wait, that's a problem. Because all four colors are used by its neighbors. So node 6 needs a fifth color, but we only have four. So that's impossible. So this attempt fails. Let's try another approach.

Now, the problem is to color this graph with four colors. So first, let's check if the graph is 4-colorable. Since it's an undirected graph, according to the four-color theorem, any planar graph is 4-colorable. But wait, is this graph planar? Wait, maybe I should check that. Wait, but perhaps the four-color theorem applies here. But maybe this graph is not planar. Let me think. A planar graph cannot contain a complete graph of five nodes (K5) as a minor. Let's see: does this graph contain K5? Let's look. For example, vertices 0,1,2,3,4. Is there a K5 among them? Let's see: 0 is connected to all. 1 is connected to 0,4,5,6,7. So 1 is connected to 0,4, but is 1 connected to 2? Looking back at the edges: the edges for 1 are (0,1), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7). So 1 is not connected to 2 or 3. So K5 would require all nodes in the subset to be connected to each other. So if I take 0,1,2,3,4, but 1 is not connected to 2 or 3. So no. Another possible subset: 0,2,4,5,7. Let's check their connections. 0 is connected to all. 2 is connected to 0,3,4,5,6,7. So 2 is connected to 0,4,5,7. Then 4 is connected to 0,1,2,3,6,7. 5 is connected to 0,1,2,7. 7 is connected to everyone. So in this subset, 0 is connected to all. 2 is connected to 0,4,5,7. 4 is connected to 0,2,5,7. 5 is connected to 0,2,7. 7 is connected to all. So in this subset, 4 is connected to 0,2,5,7. But is 4 connected to 5? Let's check edges of 4: (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,6), (4,7). So 4 is connected to 0,1,2,3,6,7. Not 5. So 4 and 5 are not connected. Therefore, in this subset, nodes 4 and 5 are not connected, so K5 is not present. Similarly, testing other subsets. Maybe this graph is planar? Hmm, not sure, but maybe it's not necessary. The four-color theorem applies to planar graphs. If the graph is non-planar, maybe it can be colored with more colors. But the question allows four colors, which is the same as the four-color theorem. But maybe the graph is 4-colorable regardless.

Hmm. So this graph is quite dense. The maximum degree here is 7, but since we have four colors, according to Brooks' theorem, a connected undirected graph can be colored with at most Δ colors unless the graph is a complete graph or an odd cycle. Since Δ here is 7, but the graph isn't a complete graph (since a complete graph with 8 vertices would have each vertex connected to 7 others, but here, vertices like 0 are connected to 6, 7 is connected to 4). So maybe Brooks' theorem would say that it can be colored with Δ colors, which is 7, but we have four colors. But Brooks' gives an upper bound, so maybe the chromatic number is lower. However, given that some vertices have such high degrees, like 7, which would require that each of those vertices has neighbors all of different colors if the chromatic number is 7, but since we can use four colors, maybe it's possible.

Wait, edge (4,5) is not present. Because in the original edge list, (4,5) isn't listed. Let's check: edges for 4 include (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,6), (4,7). So 4 is connected to 0,1,2,3,6,7. No connection to 5. Similarly, 5 is connected to 0,1,2,3,6. So 4 and 5 are not connected. Therefore, the subgraph 1,2,4,5 is not a clique. Let's check another set. For example, 1,2,3,4: 1 is connected to 2,3,4. 2 is connected to 1,4. 3 is connected to 1,4. 4 is connected to 1,2,3. But 2 and 3 are not connected. So that's not a clique. What about 1,2,5,7? 1 is connected to all. 2 is connected to 1,5,7. 5 is connected to 1,2. 7 is connected to 1,2. But 5 and 7 are not connected (checking edge list: (5,7) isn't present). So not a clique. Similarly, 1,4,6,7: 1 connected to 4,6,7. 4 connected to 1,6,7. 6 connected to 1,4,7. 7 connected to 1,4,6. But 4 and 6 are connected, 6 and 7 connected, etc. So 1,4,6,7 form a clique of size 4? Let's see: 1 connected to 4,6,7; 4 connected to 1,6,7; 6 connected to 1,4,7; 7 connected to 1,4,6. So yes, each pair among these four is connected. Therefore, there's a clique of size 4 in the subgraph 1-7. Therefore, the subgraph 1-7 is not 3-colorable, because a 4-clique requires 4 colors. Therefore, the answer would be impossible.

So vertex 6 is connected to 0 (Red), 2 (Green), 5 (Yellow), 1 (Yellow), 4,7. So when we colored vertex 6 as Blue, it's okay because vertex 3 is Blue but not connected to 6. So vertex 6 can be Blue.

Wait, wait, edge 0-6 is present, but 4 is connected to 6 via edge (4,6)? Wait, looking back at the edges listed: (0,6) and (3,6), (4,7).

Check if each in the first set is connected to all in the second set. 1 is connected to 2? No. So that doesn't work. How about 5,6,7 and 1,2,4? 5 is connected to 1,2,4. 6 is connected to 1,2,4. 7 is connected to 1,2,4. So yes, each in {5,6,7} is connected to all in {1,2,4}. So that's a K3,3. Because each of the three vertices in the first set (5,6,7) is connected to each of the three vertices in the second set (1,2,4). Therefore, the graph contains a K3,3 subgraph, making it non-planar.

Wait, but maybe the graph contains a complete subgraph with four nodes. Because if there's a K4 subgraph, then four colors would be necessary. But I need to check if any four nodes are all connected to each other. Let's see. Let's look at nodes connected to 0: 1,2,3,4,7. Are any of these forming a complete subgraph? For example, nodes 0,1,3,4. Let's see: 0 connected to 1,3,4. 1 is connected to 3 and 4. 3 is connected to 0,1,2,4. So 3 is connected to 0,1,2,4. So 0,1,3,4: 0 is connected to 1,3,4. 1 is connected to 3 and 4. But 3 is connected to 4 (since edge (3,4)? Wait, checking the edge list: original edges given are (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,7), (1,3), (1,4), (1,6), (1,7), (2,3), (2,4), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,6). So 3 and 4 are connected via (0,3) and (0,4), but wait, 3 and 4: is there an edge between 3 and 4? Let me check the edge list again. The edges are between 0 and 3, 0 and 4, 1 and 3, 1 and 4, 2 and 3, 2 and 4. Wait, there's no direct edge between 3 and 4. Oh right! So 3 and 4 are not directly connected. So the subgraph 0,1,3,4: 0 is connected to all, but 1 is connected to 3 and 4, but 3 and 4 aren't connected. So that's not a complete graph. Similarly, maybe looking at 0,1,2,3: 0 is connected to all, 1 connected to 3, 2 connected to 3. But 1 and 2 aren't connected. So not a complete subgraph.

So maybe the graph's maximum clique size is 3. For example, let's see. Let's look at node 4. It's connected to 0,1,2,5,6,7. Are there any three nodes connected to 4 that are all connected to each other? Let's check 0,1,2. 0 connected to 1 and 2. 1 connected to 0 and 2? Wait, 1 is connected to 0 (edge exists), 1 and 2: there's no edge between 1 and 2. So 0,1,2: no, only two edges. How about 0,1,7: 0 connected to 1 and 7, 1 connected to 7. So 0,1,7 form a triangle. So that's a clique of size 3. Similarly, 1,4,7: 1 connected to 4 and 7, and 4 connected to 7. So that's another triangle. So multiple cliques of size 3, but no 4-clique. Therefore, the graph's chromatic number could be 3 or 4. Since we're allowed four colors, even if it's 3, it's possible. But maybe it's 4.

Wait, the edges given include (0,7) and (2,6), but does 2 connect to 7? Let me check the edge list again. The edges for vertex 2 are (0,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6). So 2 is connected to 0,3,4,5,6. There's no edge between 2 and 7. Similarly, edge (0,7) is present, but 2 and 7 aren't directly connected. So the subset {0,2,6,7} would have edges: 0-2, 0-6, 0-7, 2-6, 6-7. So 0 is connected to all three, 2 connected to 6, 6 connected to 7. But 2 isn't connected to 7. So that's not a complete graph. Therefore, no K4 here.

So 5's neighbors are 0 (Red), 2 (Green), 3 (Blue). Therefore, 5 can't be Red, Green, Blue, so must be Yellow. Okay.

Looking for K5: We need five vertices all connected to each other. Let's see. Vertex 0 is connected to 1,2,3,6,7. Are any of those groups forming a K5? For example, 0,1,2,3: 0 is connected to all, but 1 is connected to 0,3,4,5. So 1 is not connected to 2. So no. Similarly, 0,2,3,6,7: 0 is connected to all, but 2 is connected to 0,3,4,6,7. Let's see if 3 is connected to 6 or 7. Vertex 3 is connected to 0,1,2,5. So 3 isn't connected to 6 or 7. So 3 and 6 aren't connected, so that's not a K5. How about K3,3? Let's see. Maybe a bipartition where each vertex in one set connects to all in the other. For example, maybe vertices 0,2,5 and 1,3,7. Let me check. 0 connected to 1 (yes), 3 (yes), 7 (yes). 2 connected to 1 (no), 3 (yes), 7 (yes). 5 connected to 1 (yes), 3 (yes), 7 (yes). Wait, but 0 and 2 are in the same partition. Wait, K3,3 requires two partitions each with three vertices, and every vertex in one partition connected to every in the other. So if I take partitions like {0,2,5} and {1,3,7}, check connections. 0 connects to 1,3,7 (yes). 2 connects to 1? No, 2 is connected to 0,3,4,6,7. So 2 is not connected to 1. Therefore, edge (2,1) is missing, which would be required for K3,3. So perhaps the graph is planar. If it's planar, then four colors should suffice. But maybe I'm missing something here. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to just try to color the graph step by step.

Because 2 is adjacent to 6 (Green), so 2 can't be Green. So we can't assign Green to 2. So for vertex 2, possible colors are Yellow.

0 connected to 1: yes. 0 connected to 2? The edges given are (0,1), (0,3), (0,5), (0,7). So 0 is not connected to 2. So that's a missing edge. So it's not a K5. Similarly, maybe check another set. Let's look at vertices 3,5,6,7, maybe? 3 is connected to 5,6. 5 is connected to 6,7. 6 is connected to 7. But 3 is not connected to 7. So not a K5. How about K3,3? Let's see if there's a bipartition of 3 and 3 nodes where each node in one set is connected to all in the other. Let's see. For example, check if nodes 0,5,7 (three nodes) are each connected to 1,3,4. Wait, 0 is connected to 1,3,5,7. So 0 is connected to 1,3. 5 is connected to 0,3,4,7. 7 is connected to 0,4,5,6. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe another set. Let's think of vertices 3,5,6 connected to 0,2,7. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, check vertices 3,5 as one partition. Let me think differently. Maybe vertex 3 is connected to 0,1,2,5,6. If I take 3 and connect to those five, but K3,3 requires two sets of three. Maybe not obvious. Maybe this graph is planar. Alternatively, perhaps it's non-planar. Let me count the number of edges. The graph has 16 edges. For a planar graph, the maximum number of edges is 3n - 6 where n is the number of vertices. For n=8, 3*8 -6=18. Since 16 <18, the graph could be planar. So according to the four-color theorem, it should be four-colorable. Wait, but maybe the graph is planar. So even if the maximum degree is 5, it's okay. So perhaps the graph is four-colorable. So the answer should be possible. Now I need to find a valid coloring.

Another possibility: Partition A: 2,3,4. Partition B:5, something. Let's see. 2 connected to 3,4,5. 3 connected to 2,4,5. 4 connected to 2,3,5, etc. But in a K3,3, each node in A must connect to all in B. Suppose A is 2,3,4 and B is 5,0,7. Then check if each in A connects to each in B. 2 connected to 5 (yes), 0 (no),7 (no). So no. Not a K3,3.

Wait, edges for 3 are (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (3,7). So 3 is connected to 0,1,2,7. So 3 isn't connected to 4. Similarly, 4 is connected to 0,2,5,7. So 4 isn't connected to 3.

But since there might be other structures, maybe the graph is 3-colorable? Wait, but the problem allows four colors, so even if it's 3-colorable, we can use four.

Wait, 6 is connected to 1 through the edge 1-5-6? No, edges are direct. Let's check edges. 6 is connected to 0,3,4,5,7. So 6 is connected to 0 (yes), but not directly to 1 or 4. Wait, 6 is connected to 4 (yes) via edge 4-6. So 6 is connected to 4, but in the hypothetical K3,3, the partitions would be {3,7,6} and {0,1,4}. Then 3 is connected to 0,1,4. 7 is connected to 0,1,4. 6 is connected to 0,4. Wait, but 6 is connected to 0 and 4, but not to 1. So that's missing 6-1. Thus, not all connections. So this isn't K3,3.

Vertex 4 is connected to 0,1,3,4's edges: wait, (4,5), (4,6), (4,7) as well as edges from 0,1,3. Wait, let me check. The edges for 4 are: (0,4), (1,4), (3,4), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7). So vertex 4 has degree 6? That's a lot. So vertex 4 is connected to 0,1,3,5,6,7. That's six neighbors. Similarly, vertex 5 is connected to 0,2,4,6,7. So five neighbors.

Looking at the edges: vertices 1 is connected to 0,2,3,4,6,7. So 1 is connected to six vertices, but does any subset of five form a complete graph? Let's see. For example, vertices 1,2,3,4,6. Let's check if all pairs are connected. 1 is connected to 2,3,4,6. 2 is connected to 1,3,4,5. So 2-3, 2-4 are edges. 3 is connected to 1,2,5,7. So 3-4? No, edge (3,4) isn't listed. So 3 and 4 are not connected. So this subset isn't a complete graph. How about another set? Like 1,2,3,5,7. 1 connected to 2,3,5 (no, 1 is connected to 5? Wait, 1 is connected to 0,2,3,4,6,7. So 1 isn't connected to 5. So 1-5 is not an edge. Therefore, the subset 1,2,3,5,7 would need 1 connected to 5, which isn't the case. So no, the graph doesn't contain K5. Similarly for K3,3. Let's see if there's a bipartition of 3+3 vertices with all edges between. Not sure. Maybe the graph is planar. If it's planar, then four colors suffice.

Oh, that's a problem. Because vertex 3 is yellow, and vertex 4 is connected to it. So if I assign yellow to vertex 4, that would conflict with vertex 3. Hmm, so that approach doesn't work.

Let's check 1,4,5,6,7. Vertex 1 is connected to 0,2,4,5. Not connected to 6 or 7. So no. How about 2,4,5,6,7? Let's check mutual connections. Vertex 2 is connected to 4,5,6,7.

Maybe a bipartition. Not sure. Maybe the graph is planar. Let's assume it's planar for now, given that four colors are possible per the theorem. But even if it's non-planar, maybe it's still 4-colorable. For example, K5 isn't 4-colorable, but if the graph doesn't contain such a subgraph, maybe it's okay.

For example, take vertices 1,5,6,2,4. Let's see: 1 is connected to 5,6,4,2 (since 1 is connected to 0,4,5,6,7. Wait, 1 is not connected to 2. So 1 is connected to 4,5,6,7, but not to 2.

No. So no. 2,5,6: yes, 2 is connected to 5 and 6; 5 is connected to 6. So a triangle. But not a K4. Similarly, 4 is connected to 1,2,3,6,7. Let's check if 4's neighbors form a complete subgraph. 1 connected to 2? No. 1 connected to 3? No, because 1 is connected to 0,4,5,6,7. So 1 is not connected to 3. So 4's neighbors (1,2,3,6,7) are not all connected. So no K5 subgraph. Similarly, K3,3 would require a bipartition of 3 and 3 vertices with all edges between them. Not sure. Maybe not. So possibly the graph is planar. If it's planar, then by the four-color theorem, it can be colored with four colors. Therefore, it's possible.

So vertex 6 is connected to 0,1,2,3,4,5,7. So indeed, vertex 6 has degree 7. Similarly, vertex 7 is connected to 0,1,2,4,5,6. So six edges. So vertex 7 has degree 6.

Looking for K5: A complete graph with 5 vertices where each vertex is connected to every other. Let's check. For example, vertex 0 is connected to 2,3,4,5,6,7. Let's see if any five of these form a K5. Take vertices 0,2,3,4,5. Is 0 connected to all? Yes. But are they all connected to each other? 2 is connected to 3,4,5. 3 is connected to 2,4. 4 is connected to 2,3. 5 is connected to 2. Wait, 5 is not connected to 3 or 4. So this isn't a K5. Similarly, checking other groups. How about 0,2,3,7,5? 0 is connected to all. 2 is connected to 3,5,7. 3 is connected to 2,7 (since 3 is connected to 7 via 0? Wait, no. Wait, 3 is connected to 7? Let's check the edge list. The edges including 3 are (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (3,4), (3,6). So 3 is connected to 0,1,2,4,6. Not to 7. So 3 and 7 are not directly connected. So that group isn't K5. Maybe another combination. How about 2,3,4,5,7? 2 is connected to 3,4,5,7. 3 is connected to 2,4. 4 is connected to 2,3,7. 5 is connected to 2,7. 7 is connected to 2,4,5. So 5 and 7 are connected, but 5 isn't connected to 3 or 4. So that's not a K5. Maybe another set. Maybe 0,2,5,7,4? 0 is connected to all. 2 is connected to 0,5,7,4. 5 is connected to 0,2,7. 7 is connected to 0,2,4,5. 4 is connected to 0,2,7. But 5 and 4 aren't connected.

So vertex 5 is the most connected. Let's check if there's a K5. For example, check if any 5-clique exists. Let's look at vertex 0: neighbors are 1,2,4,5. Are these four vertices all connected to each other? 1 is connected to 2,4,5 (yes), 2 is connected to 1,4 (no, 2 is connected to 1,5,6,7. Wait, 2's neighbors: 0,1,5,6,7. So in the neighbors of 0, 1,2,4,5: check if 1 and 4 are connected (yes, edge (1,4)), 1 and 5 (yes), 2 and 4 (edge (0,2) and (0,4) but is there (2,4)? Let's check the edge list: looking through the edges, (2,4) is not listed. Wait, the edges for 2: (0,2), (1,2), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7). So 2 is connected to 0,1,5,6,7. So 2 is not connected to 4. Therefore, in the neighbors of 0 (1,2,4,5), 2 is not connected to 4, so no K5 here.

So that's a K5 (0,4,5,6,7), each connected to each other except maybe some. Wait, 0 is connected to 4,5,6,7. 4 is connected to 0,5,6,7. 5 is connected to 0,4,6,7. 6 is connected to 0,4,5,7. 7 is connected to all of them. Wait, each pair among these five nodes is connected except maybe between 0 and 4, 0 and5, etc. Wait, 0 is connected to 4,5,6,7. 4 is connected to 0,5,6,7.

Wait, but maybe a better approach is to see if there are any cliques. For example, in the subgraph, is there a clique of size 4? Let's see. For instance, vertex 5 is connected to 2,3,4,7. So vertex 5 is connected to four others. So the subgraph may have a clique of size 4? Let's check. Are vertices 2,3,4,5 all connected to each other? 2 is connected to 3,4,5. 3 is connected to 2,5,6. 4 is connected to 2,5,6. 5 is connected to 2,3,4,7. So 2,3,4,5 form a clique? No, because 3 and 4 are not connected. Edge between 3 and 4? Looking at the edges, there's no (3,4). The edges for 3 are (0,3), (2,3), (3,5), (3,6). So no edge between 3 and 4. So the maximum clique size in the subgraph might be 3. For example, vertex 2,3,5: 2 connected to 3 and 5, 3 connected to 5. So that's a triangle. Similarly, 2,4,5: 2 connected to 4 and 5, 4 connected to 5. Also a triangle. Similarly, 5,6,7: 5 connected to 7, 7 connected to 6, 6 connected to 5? Wait, 5 connected to 7 (yes), 7 connected to 6 (yes), 6 connected to 5 (yes). So 5,6,7 form a triangle. So there are multiple triangles in the subgraph.

Looking at the edges, let's see if any 5 vertices are all connected to each other. Let's check vertex 0: connected to 2,3,4,6,7. So 0 is connected to 5 vertices. Let's check if any of those form a complete subgraph. For example, 0,2,3,6,7. Does 2 connect to 3? Yes. 2 to 6? Yes. 2 to 7? The edge list has (0,7), (2,6), (2,3), but I don't see a (2,7) edge. So 2 is connected to 0,3,6. So maybe not a K5 here. What about vertex 3? It's connected to 0,1,2,4,5,7. That's six edges. Let me check if the subgraph around 3 is a complete graph. The neighbors of 3 are 0,1,2,4,5,7. Let's see if all those are connected to each other. For example, 0 and 1: edge? No, the edges from 0 don't include 1. So 0 and 1 aren't connected. So that can't be a complete subgraph. So maybe there's no K5 here. Similarly, check if there's a K3,3 subgraph, which is another non-planar graph. K3,3 is a bipartite graph with each partition having 3 nodes, and every node in one partition connected to every node in the other. Let's see. Maybe the graph is bipartite? Let me check. If I can split the vertices into two sets with no edges within the same set. But given the edges, it's unclear. For example, vertex 0 is connected to 2,3,4,6,7. If 0 is in set A, then 2,3,4,6,7 must be in set B. Then their neighbors must be in set A. But let's take vertex 2, which is connected to 0,3,6. Since 2 is in set B, 3 and 6 must be in set A. But 3 is connected to 0 (set B), which is okay, but 3 is also connected to 1,4,5,7. If 3 is in set A, then 1,4,5,7 must be in set B. But 7 is connected to 0 (set B) and 6 (set A). Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe the graph isn't bipartite, which is okay because K3,3 is bipartite but non-planar. But I'm not sure if this graph contains a K3,3. Let me try to check. Suppose we take some partition. For instance, maybe vertices 0,1,2 in one set and 3,4,5 in another. Wait, but edges like (0,3), (0,4), etc., would cross. But K3,3 requires each node in one partition connected to all nodes in the other. Let me see. Let's check if any three nodes are each connected to three other nodes. For example, take nodes 3,4,5. Node 3 is connected to 0,1,2,4,5,7. Node 4 is connected to 0,1,3,5,6,7. Node 5 is connected to 1,3,4,6. Hmm, maybe not exactly. Alternatively, nodes 6 and 7 are connected to many. Maybe this is getting too convoluted. Since the graph has exactly 18 edges, which is the maximum for a planar graph, perhaps it's planar. If that's the case, then by the four-color theorem, it can be colored with four colors. So maybe it's possible. But maybe the problem is that even if it's planar, finding the actual coloring might be tricky. Let me try to construct a coloring step by step.

Looking at the edges, does any subset of 5 vertices form a complete graph? Let's check vertex 3. It's connected to 0,1,2,4,5,7. Let's see: taking vertices 0,1,3,4,5. Does this form a K5? Let's check all possible edges between them. 0 is connected to 3,4. 1 is connected to 3,4,5. 3 is connected to all. 4 is connected to 0,1,3,5. 5 is connected to 1,3,4. So not a K5 because, for example, 0 isn't connected to 1 or 5. So maybe no K5. How about K3,3? Let's see. For K3,3, two sets of three vertices each with all edges between them. Maybe check 0,2,6 and 3,4,7. Let's see: 0 connected to 3,4,6,7; 2 connected to 3,6; 6 connected to 3,4,5,7. Not exactly all connections. Maybe another set. Alternatively, maybe the graph is planar.

So, in the subgraph induced by 0,4,5,6,7: each of these is connected to the others except 0 isn't connected to 3, but 3 isn't in this group. Wait, but 0 is connected to 4,5,6,7. Then, 4 is connected to 5,6,7. 5 is connected to 4,6,7. 6 is connected to 4,5,7. 7 is connected to all except 3. So the subgraph including 4,5,6,7 is a complete graph? Let's see: 4-5, 4-6, 4-7; 5-6, 5-7; 6-7. So yes, the subgraph induced by 4,5,6,7 is a complete graph K4. Because each of them is connected to each other. That's a clique of size 4. So in a K4, each node is connected to every other, so each needs a different color. Therefore, at least four colors are needed. Since the problem allows four colors, that's okay. But we need to check if the entire graph can be colored with four colors, considering that the K4 is part of it.

Let me check: looking at the original edge list. The edges for 5: (0,5), (1,5), (3,5), (4,5). So 5 is connected to 0,1,3,4. So 5 is not connected to 6. Therefore, 5 is not adjacent to 6. Therefore, 5 can be colored Green even if 6 is Green. Wait, no, if 5 is connected to 6, then they can't share the same color. But since there's no edge between 5 and 6, then 5 can be Green even if 6 is Green. So 5's color is not restricted by 6's color. Therefore, since 5's neighbors are 0 (unknown yet),1 (Yellow),3 (Red),4 (Blue). So 5 can't be Yellow, Red, Blue. So only Green left. So 5: Green.

For a planar graph, the maximum number of edges is 3n -6 where n is the number of vertices. Here n=8, so 3*8-6=18. But this graph has 19 edges, which is more than 18. Therefore, by the simple edge count, the graph is non-planar. Therefore, it cannot be planar. So the four-color theorem doesn't apply here. So the fact that it's non-planar doesn't necessarily mean it can't be colored with four colors, but some non-planar graphs might require more. For example, K5 requires five colors.

Vertex 6: connected to 1,3,4,5,7. Wait, from edges listed: (1,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), and (5,7)? Wait, no, (5,7) is an edge. Wait, vertex 6 is connected to 1,3,4,5,7? Let me check again. The edges involving 6 are (1,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), and (4,7) includes 7. Wait, wait: edges for 6 are (1,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6). So degree 4 for vertex 6. Then vertex 7 is connected to 1,2,4,5. Let's check: edges (1,7), (2,7), (4,7), (5,7). So vertex 7 has degree 4.

Take vertices 1,2,3,4. Are they a clique? 1 connected to 2,3,4. 2 connected to 1,3,4. But 3 connected to 1,2, but 3 is not connected to 4 (edge between 3 and 4? Let's check edges. The edges listed: (1,4) exists, (2,4) exists, but (3,4) is not listed. So 3 is connected to 1 and 2, but not to 4. So 1,2,3,4 is not a clique. How about 1,2,4,5? 1 connected to 2,4,5 (1 is connected to 5 via (0,5), wait no: wait, vertex 1 is connected to 0,2,3,4,6,7. 1 is not directly connected to 5. Wait, original edges: (0,5) connects 0 and 5. (1,5) is not an edge. So vertex 1 is not connected to 5. So any clique involving 1 and 5 would need other connections. Let's check vertex 2. Vertex 2 is connected to 0,1,3,4,5,7. Let's see if 2,5,4,7 form a clique. 2 connected to 5, yes. 2 connected to 4, yes. 2 connected to 7, yes. 5 connected to 4? Yes, edge (4,5). 5 connected to 7? Yes, edge (5,7). 4 connected to 7? Yes, edge (4,7). So 2,4,5,7 form a clique of size 4. Because each pair among them is connected. 2-4, 2-5, 2-7, 4-5, 4-7, 5-7. So that's a 4-clique. Therefore, the graph has a clique of size 4, which means that at least 4 colors are needed. But since we're allowed to use 4 colors, maybe it's possible. So if the clique is size 4 and that's the maximum, then 4 colors should suffice. But we need to confirm if the graph is 4-colorable.

Let me backtrack. When we assigned vertex 1 as Red, leading to vertex 2 needing to be Green or Blue. Let's try Blue instead of Green for vertex 2. So vertex 2: Blue. Then, vertex 6's neighbors are 0 (Red), 1 (Red), 2 (Blue),4 (Blue),5 (Yellow),7. So neighbors' colors: Red, Red, Blue, Blue, Yellow. So vertex 6 can't be Red, Blue, or Yellow. So only possible color is Green. Assign vertex 6: Green. Then check vertex 7, which is connected to 1 (Red), 2 (Blue),3 (Green),4 (Blue),6 (Green). So neighbors' colors: Red, Blue, Green, Blue, Green. So vertex 7 can't be Red, Blue, or Green. So it must be Yellow. But vertex 5 is already Yellow, and vertex 7 is connected to 5 (edge 5-7? Wait, checking the edges list: 5 is connected to 0,1,2,3,4. So 5 is not connected to 7. Wait, looking back at the edges list: vertex 3 is connected to 7 (edge (3,7)), vertex 4 is connected to 7 (edge (4,7)), vertex 1 is connected to 7 (edge (1,7)), vertex 2 is connected to 7 (edge (2,7)), vertex 6 is connected to 7 (edge (6,7)). But 5 is not connected to 7. So vertex 7 is connected to 1,2,3,4,6. So vertex 7's neighbors are 1 (Red), 2 (Blue), 3 (Green),4 (Blue),6 (Green). Therefore, colors to avoid: Red, Blue, Green. So vertex 7 must be Yellow. But since 7 is not connected to 5 (Yellow), that's acceptable. So vertex 7: Yellow.

Alternatively, let's try vertex 2 as Blue. Then, neighbors 3,4,5,7 can't be Blue. 4,5,7 must be Green or Yellow (since they can't be Red or Blue). So 4,5,7 can be Green or Yellow, but now they can't be Blue. So let's proceed. Assign 4 as Green. Then 5 can't be Green (since connected to 4), so 5 must be Yellow. 7 can be either Green or Yellow, but if 7 is Green, then 4 and 7 would be Green but connected? Wait, 4 and 7: are they connected? Looking at the edges, 4 is connected to 0,1,2,3,5. No edge between 4 and 7. Wait, but vertex 7 is connected to 0,1,2,3. So 4 and 7 are not directly connected. So 4 can be Green, 7 can be Green. Then 5 is Yellow, 7 is Green. Then 5 (Yellow) and 7 (Green) are okay. Now, let's look at vertex 3. It's connected to 0 (Red), 2 (Blue), 4 (Green), and others. So vertex 3 can't be Red, Blue, or Green. So it must be Yellow. Then, vertex 3 is Yellow. Now, neighbors of 3 are 4 (Green), 5 (Yellow), 6,7 (Green). So 6 and 7 can't be Yellow. But vertex 6 is connected to 0 (Red), 1 (Blue), and 3 (Yellow). So 6 can't be Red, Blue, or Yellow. So it must be Green. But 1 is Blue, so Green is okay. So 6 is Green. Then vertex 7 is connected to 0 (Red), 1 (Blue), 2 (Blue), 3 (Yellow). So 7 can't be Red, Blue, or Yellow. So it must be Green. But 7 is connected to 6 (Green), which is a problem. Because 6 is Green and 7 is Green, but they are connected via edge (1,7) and (1,6), but wait, 6 and 7 are connected via edge (3,6) and (3,7), and maybe others? Wait, looking back at the edges, is there an edge between 6 and 7? Let me check. The edges given: (0,6), (1,6), (3,6). For vertex 7: (0,7), (1,7), (2,7), (3,7). So no edge between 6 and 7. So 6 and 7 can both be Green. So that's okay. So let's check the assignments so far:

But 3 isn't connected to 5, and 5 isn't connected to 3. So not a K5. What about another subset? Like 3,5,6,7,4. Let's see: 3 connected to 5? No. 5 is connected to 6,7,4. 3 is connected to 6,7,4.

The edges for 3 are (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (3,4), (3,6), (3,7). So no, 3 is not connected to 5. So maybe the K5 isn't present here. Similarly, K3,3? Let's see.

But 3 is connected to 0,1,2,4,6,7. Hmm, maybe there's a bipartite subgraph here, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the graph is planar.

If it's non-planar, it might still be 4-colorable, but we can't be sure.

So vertices 2 and 3 each have degree 6, which is quite high. The maximum degree here is 6. Wait, but according to some graph coloring rules, if a graph has maximum degree Δ, then it can be colored with Δ+1 colors. Here, the maximum degree is 6, so 7 colors would be needed in the worst case, but we're only allowed four colors. Hmm, but maybe the structure isn't as bad as that. Maybe the graph is 4-colorable despite the high degrees. Let's check if it's a planar graph. Wait, planar graphs are 4-colorable by the four-color theorem. Is this graph planar? Let me think. Planar graphs can be drawn without edge crossings. But the given edges might include some that cross. Let me see: maybe with vertices 0 connected to 1,2,3,5. Vertex 2 connected to 4,5,6,7. Vertex 3 connected to 4,5,6,7. Vertex 4 connected to 2,3,5,6. Vertex 5 connected to 0,2,3,4,6,7. Vertex 6 connected to 2,3,4,5,7. Vertex 7 connected to 2,3,5,6. Hmm, perhaps this graph is non-planar. For example, if there's a K5 subgraph or a K3,3 subgraph. Let's check for K5: take vertices 2,3,5,6,7. Are they all connected to each other? Let's see. 2 is connected to 5,6,7. 3 is connected to 5,6,7. 5 is connected to 6,7. 6 is connected to 7. But 2 and 3 are not connected to each other through all the nodes. Wait, 2 and 3 are connected. So maybe in the subset 2,3,5,6,7: each is connected to the others except maybe between 2 and 7: yes, 2 is connected to 7. 3 is connected to 7. So in this subset, every pair except maybe 5 and 7? Wait, 5 and 7 are connected. So 2,3,5,7: each pair is connected. But 6 is connected to all except maybe not to some? Wait, 6 is connected to 2,3,4,5,7. So in the subset 2,3,5,6,7: 2 is connected to 3,5,6,7. 3 is connected to 2,5,6,7. 5 is connected to 2,3,6,7. 6 is connected to 2,3,5,7. 7 is connected to 2,3,5,6. So that's a complete graph K5. Because each of the five vertices is connected to the other four. So K5 is a subgraph, which is non-planar. Therefore, the graph is non-planar. But the four-color theorem applies to planar graphs. Since this graph is non-planar, the four-color theorem doesn't guarantee 4-colorability. But maybe it's still 4-colorable. So I can't rely on that; I have to check manually.

Yes! So the subgraph formed by vertices 2,5,6,7 is a complete graph K4. That means each of these four vertices must have different colors. Since we have exactly four colors, that's possible. So those four must each be a unique color. Similarly, vertex 3 is connected to 4,5,6,7. Wait, vertex 3 is connected to 4,5,6,7. Let's check if 3 is part of a K4. For example, 3,5,6,7: 3-5 is connected, 3-6, 3-7, and 5-6,5-7,6-7 are all connected. So another K4 here. So both 2,5,6,7 and 3,5,6,7 are K4s. But wait, vertex 3 is connected to 2 as well (edge 0-3? Wait no, vertex 3 is connected to 0,1,4,5,6,7. So 3 is connected to 0,1,4,5,6,7. So 3 is connected to 5,6,7, which are in the first K4. So vertex 3 is adjacent to all of 5,6,7, which are each in different colors. Therefore, vertex 3 must have a color different from the colors of 5,6,7. But since those three are already using three different colors (from the K4), vertex 3 needs a fourth color. But wait, in the first K4 (2,5,6,7), the four colors are used. Then vertex 3 is connected to 5,6,7, so it can't take any of those three colors, but the fourth color is already used by vertex 2. Wait, is vertex 3 connected to vertex 2? Let me check the edges. The edges for vertex 3: 0,1,4,5,6,7. So no, vertex 3 is not connected to vertex 2. Wait, the edges given: (0,3), (1,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7). So vertex 3 is connected to 0,1,4,5,6,7. So vertex 3 is not connected to 2. Therefore, even though vertex 3 is connected to 5,6,7 (which are in a K4 with 2), vertex 3 is not connected to 2. So vertex 3's color just needs to be different from 5,6,7. Since 5,6,7 are three different colors, vertex 3 can take the fourth color. But wait, but vertex 3 is part of another K4? Let me check the subgraph 3,5,6,7. Are all edges present? 3-5,3-6,3-7,5-6,5-7,6-7. Yes, that's another K4. So that's a problem. Because if 3,5,6,7 form a K4, then they all need different colors. But 5,6,7 are already in the K4 with 2. Wait, but 5,6,7 are part of two different K4s: one with 2 and one with 3. So in total, the K4s are 2,5,6,7 and 3,5,6,7. Therefore, in this case, to color both K4s, 5,6,7 must each have unique colors, and both 2 and 3 must have a color different from each other and from 5,6,7. But since there are four colors, 2,3,5,6,7 would require five colors unless some colors can be shared. Wait, but 2 and 3 are not connected. So maybe 2 and 3 can have the same color? Wait, but 2 is connected to 5,6,7, and 3 is also connected to 5,6,7. So if 2 and 3 are the same color, that color must not be used by 5,6,7. But since 5,6,7 are all different colors (from the first K4), and 2 is using the fourth color. Then 3 could use the same color as 2, but only if 3 is not adjacent to 2. Since 3 and 2 are not connected, that's allowed. So let's see.

Looking at K5: The complete graph K5 has 5 vertices each connected to every other. Let's see. Vertex 1 is connected to 2,3,4,5,6,7. So vertex 1 has degree 6. Let's see if there's a K5 here. For example, vertices 1,3,4,5,6,7. Maybe a subset. Let's check if any 5 vertices are all interconnected. Let's check vertices 1,3,5,6,7. Are all these connected? 1 is connected to all. 3 is connected to 1,5 (is 3 connected to 5? The edges for 3 are (0,3), (1,3), (3,4), (3,6), (3,7). So 3 is connected to 1,0,4,6,7. Wait, 3 is not connected to 5. So 3 and 5 are not connected. So that's not a K5. How about vertices 1,5,6,7? Let's see. 1 is connected to 5,6,7. 5 is connected to 6 and 7 (edges (5,6), (5,7)), and 6 is connected to 7. So 1,5,6,7 form a complete graph K4. But not K5. Similarly, maybe other subsets. Let's check if there's a K3,3. For example, bipartition (A,B) where each node in A is connected to each in B. Let's see. For example, maybe vertices 0,1,2 in A and 3,4,5 in B. But 0 is connected to 3,4,5,6,7. 1 is connected to 3,4,5,6,7. 2 is connected to 1 and 5. Not sure. Maybe another way. Alternatively, maybe the graph is non-planar. But without a clear K5 or K3,3, it's hard to say. Alternatively, use Euler's formula: for planar graphs, |E| ≤ 3|V| -6. Here, |V|=8, so 3*8-6=18. Let's count the edges. The edge list is as follows:

Looking at the edges, does any subset of 5 vertices form a complete graph? Let's take vertices 0,3,4,5,6,7. Wait, 0 is connected to 3,4,5,6,7. But are all those connected among themselves? For example, 3 is connected to 4 (yes, edge (3,4)), 3 connected to 5 (no, wait, looking at vertex 3's edges: 0,1,4,6,7. So 3 is not connected to 5. So 0,3,4,5,6,7: 3 is not connected to 5, so that's not a complete subgraph. Similarly, check 1's connections: 1 is connected to 2,3,4,5,6,7. Let's see if 1,3,4,5,6,7 form a K6. No, because for example, 3 and 5 are not connected. Wait, 3's edges: 0,1,4,6,7. So 3 is connected to 1,4,6,7 but not to 5. So even among 1's neighbors, they aren't all connected to each other. So maybe there's no K5 here. Similarly, checking for K3,3. Maybe. But perhaps this graph is planar after all. But maybe not necessary. Let's try to proceed with coloring.

Alternatively, maybe try to assign colors step by step. Let's start with the highest degree nodes. Since 1 and 5 have degree 6, which is the highest. Let's start with vertex 1. Assign it Red. Then its neighbors (2,3,4,5,6,7) can't be Red. Then vertex 2 is connected to 1 and 5. Let's assign vertex 2 a color different from Red. Let's say Green. Then vertex 5 is connected to 1 (Red), so it can't be Red. Let's assign vertex 5 Blue. Now, vertex 5's other neighbors: 0,1,2,4,6,7. So 0 is connected to 5 (Blue). 4 is connected to 5 (Blue), 6 and 7 are connected to 5 (Blue).

Now, vertex 3. Neighbors: 0 (Green),1 (Blue),2 (Green),5 (Green),6 (Blue). So forbidden colors: Green, Blue. Available: Red, Yellow. But vertex 3 is connected to 5 (Green), which is connected to vertex 3. So 3 can't be Green. Wait, but vertex 5 is Green, and 3 is connected to 5, so yes, 3 can't be Green. Also, 3's neighbors: 0 (Green),1 (Blue),2 (Green),5 (Green),6 (Blue). So forbidden colors are Green and Blue. So available colors: Red and Yellow. Let's pick Red for 3. Wait, but vertex 4 is Red, and 3 is connected to 4. Oh right! Vertex 3 is connected to 4 (Red). So 3 cannot be Red. Oh, right! So 3's neighbors: 0 (Green),1 (Blue),2 (Green),4 (Red),5 (Green),6 (Blue). So forbidden colors: Green, Blue, Red. Therefore, the only available color is Yellow. Assign 3: Yellow.

How about K3,3? A bipartite complete graph with 3 nodes on each side. Let's see. For example, maybe vertices 1,2,3 connected to 4,5,6 or something. Let me check. For K3,3, we need two sets of three vertices each, with each vertex in one set connected to all in the other. Let me see. For example, take vertices 0,1,2 and 4,5,6. But 0 is connected to 4,5,6. 1 is connected to 4,5,6. 2 is connected to 4,5, but not 6. So 2 isn't connected to 6, so that's not a K3,3. Maybe another set. How about vertices 1,6,7 and 4,5, something? Wait, 1 is connected to 4,5,6,7. Not sure. Maybe this approach is not the best.

So vertices 1 and 4 are not directly connected. So assigning Yellow to vertex 4 is okay because it's not adjacent to vertex 1. So vertex 4 is Yellow.

Wait, 3's neighbors are 1 (Red), 2 (Green), 5,6 (Blue),7 (Yellow). So the colors used by neighbors are Red, Green, Blue, Yellow. So all four colors are taken. Therefore, vertex 3 can't be colored.

Looking at vertex 1: connected to 2,3,4,5,6,7. So vertex 1 is connected to six other vertices. If any five of those form a complete subgraph among themselves, then it would contain a K5. Let's check if any of vertex 1's neighbors are connected to each other. For example, 2 is connected to 3,5,6,7; 3 is connected to 2,5, etc. But not all of them are connected. For instance, 2 is connected to 3,5,6,7 but maybe not all the others. Similarly, 4 is connected to 0,1,5,6,7. Wait, does vertex 4 connect to 2? No. So maybe not a complete subgraph.

Now, vertex 6 is connected to 1 (Green), 3 (Blue), 4 (Green), 5 (Yellow), 7 (Green). So vertex 6 can't be Green, Blue, or Yellow. Wait, that's a problem. Because the available colors are Green, Blue, Yellow, but 6 can't take any of them? That's impossible. So this coloring attempt leads to a conflict at vertex 6.

So, vertex 0 is the central node connected to everyone. Then the other nodes form their own connections. Let's try to visualize this. Maybe 0 is in the center, and then the other vertices form a sort of outer ring with their own edges. But looking at the edges for 3 and 4, they are connected to many others. For example, 3 is connected to 1,4,5,6,7. So 3 is also a highly connected node. Similarly, 4 is connected to 2,3,5,6,7. Hmm, maybe there's a lot of overlap here.

Looking at the edges: Vertex 0 is connected to all others, so if any four of the other vertices form a complete subgraph among themselves, then the subgraph including 0 would form K5. Let's check the neighbors of 0. Vertex 0 is connected to 1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Now, looking at the connections among these. For example, let's look at vertices 3,4,5,6,7. Vertex 3 is connected to 4,5,6,7. 4 is connected to 5,6,7. 5 is connected to 7 and 6. 6 is connected to 7. Wait, so 3,4,5,6,7: each of these is connected to several others. Let's check if 3,4,5,6,7 form a complete graph. But in a complete graph, every pair must be connected. Let's see:

Looking at the edges, vertex 0 is connected to every other vertex except itself. So vertex 0 has degree 7. Then, other vertices like 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 have several connections. For example, vertex 1 is connected to 0, 3, 5, 6. Vertex 3 is connected to 0,1,4,5,6,7. That's a high degree. Maybe this graph contains a complete subgraph of size 5, which would make it non-planar because K5 isn't planar. Let's check. Let's see if there's a subset of 5 vertices where each is connected to every other. Let's look at vertices 0,3,4,5,6. Vertex 0 is connected to all. Vertex 3 is connected to 0,4,5,6. But 3 is not connected to 4? Wait, the edges include (3,4). Yes, so 3 is connected to 4. Then, 3 is connected to 0,4,5,6,7. So in the subset 0,3,4,5,6, let's check all connections. 0 is connected to all. 3 is connected to 0,4,5,6. 4 is connected to 0,2,3,5,6,7. Wait, 4 is connected to 5 (yes, edge (4,5)), connected to 6 (yes, edge (4,6)), connected to 3 (yes). So between 3 and 4, there's an edge. Between 4 and 5, edge. 4 and 6, edge. 3 and 5, edge. 3 and 6, edge. So in the subset 0,3,4,5,6, each pair except maybe some. Let's list all possible pairs:

Looking at vertex 0: connected to 1,2,3,4,5,6. So if any of those form a K5 among themselves, then the graph is non-planar. Let me check if any five of 1,2,3,4,5,6 are all connected to each other. Let's see. For example, vertices 1,4,5,6: 1 is connected to 4,5,6. 4 is connected to 5,6. 5 is connected to 4,6. 6 is connected to 4,5. But that's not a K5. Maybe another group. Let's look at vertex 6: connected to 0,1,2,3,4,7. So vertex 6 is connected to many. Let me check if among its neighbors, there's a K4. For example, vertices 0,1,2,3,4,7. Wait, but 0 isn't connected to 7. Let me check connections between 1,2,3,4,7. 1 is connected to 4,5,6,7. So 1 connected to 4 and 7. 2 is connected to 3,6,7. 3 is connected to 4,6,7. 4 is connected to 1,3,5,6. 7 is connected to 1,2,3,5,6. Hmm, maybe there's a K3,3 here. Let's see. For K3,3, we need two sets of three vertices each, all connected across the sets. Let's see. Maybe 0 is connected to 1,2,3,4,5,6. If 0 is part of a K3,3, but maybe not. Alternatively, maybe between vertices 1,4,5 and 2,3,7? Let me check. 1 is connected to 2? No. 1 is connected to 4,5,6,7. 4 is connected to 2? No. 4 is connected to 0,1,3,5,6. Wait, maybe another combination. Alternatively, maybe the graph is planar. But this might be getting too complicated. Alternatively, maybe the graph is non-planar, but the four-color theorem might not apply here. However, the problem allows four colors, so even if it's non-planar, perhaps it can still be colored with four colors. The four-color theorem only guarantees that planar graphs can be colored with four, but non-planar graphs might require more, but not necessarily. So maybe even if it's non-planar, it's possible. So perhaps better to proceed with trying to color it.

Wait, original edges: looking back, edges for 1 are (0,1), (1,2), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7). So 1 is connected to 0,2,5,6,7. Not to 3. So 1 is not connected to 3. Therefore, when I assigned 3 as Green, that doesn't affect vertex 1. So when I assigned 1 as Green, that's allowed because 1 isn't adjacent to 3. Wait, that's a critical mistake I made.

Hmm. Let me try to visualize this. Vertex 0 seems to be connected to a lot of others: 1,2,3,4,6,7. So vertex 0 has degree 6. Similarly, vertex 2 is connected to 0,1,3,4,5,6,7. Wait, that's 7 edges. So vertex 2 has degree 7? Let me check. From the edge list, vertex 2 is connected to 0,1,3,4,5,6,7. Yes, seven edges. So vertex 2 is connected to every other vertex except maybe itself. Wait, but the vertices are 0-7. So vertex 2 is connected to 0,1,3,4,5,6,7. That's seven vertices. So vertex 2 has degree 7. Similarly, vertex 6 is connected to 0,1,2,3,4,5,7? Let me count.

Looking at vertex 6, which is connected to all others except itself. So the neighbors of 6 are 0,1,2,3,4,5,7. If among these, any five are all connected to each other, that would form a K5. Let's see: Take vertices 0,1,2,3,4. Are all connected to each other? 0 is connected to 2,3,4, but not to 1. So 0 isn't connected to 1. So that's not a complete subgraph. How about 2,3,4,5,6?

The edge list includes (2,3), (2,4), but (3,4) isn't listed. So no edge between 3 and 4. Similarly, 3-4: not present. Therefore, the subgraph 2,3,4,5,6 is not complete.

Planar graphs have no subgraphs that are K5 or K3,3 minors. Alternatively, by Kuratowski's theorem, a graph is planar if it doesn't contain a subgraph that is a subdivision of K5 or K3,3. Let me see. Let's check if there's a K5 here. Looking at the edges, vertex 0 is connected to 1,2,4,6,7. So maybe 0 and these five neighbors. But K5 would require all of them to be connected to each other. Let's check if, say, 1 is connected to 2,4,6,7. 1 is connected to 2,5,7, and 0. So no, 1 isn't connected to 4 or 6. So not a K5. Similarly, checking other groups. Maybe vertex 2: connected to 0,1,3,4,5,6. Let's see if 0,1,3,4,5,6 form a K5. But again, not all connected. So perhaps the graph is planar. Wait, but maybe it's not. Alternatively, perhaps the graph is non-planar, making the four-color theorem not applicable. Hmm. But even if it's non-planar, the question allows four colors. Wait, the four-color theorem is for planar graphs. Non-planar graphs can have higher chromatic numbers, but since we're allowed four colors here, maybe it's possible. Let me check the maximum degree. The highest degree is 6. Wait, but according to Brooks' theorem, a connected graph (other than a complete graph or an odd cycle) has chromatic number at most Δ, the maximum degree. Here, Δ is 6, but Brooks' theorem says the chromatic number is at most Δ unless it's a complete graph or an odd cycle. Since this graph isn't a complete graph (since, for example, vertex 2 has degree 6, but there are 8 vertices, so a complete graph of 8 vertices would have degree 7 for each node), so Brooks' theorem says it can be colored with at most 6 colors. But the question is if 4 colors suffice. So it's possible, but maybe not guaranteed. Let's try to find a 4-coloring.

Wait, the edges listed for 6: (1,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), and (5,7) but wait, 6's edges: from the list, edges involving 6 are (1,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), and (4,7), (5,7) but no, (4,7) is another edge. Wait, let me check again. The edges are:

False edges:
(6, 7) [Manual assessment: N/A]

- 1 connected to 6: Let's check. The edge list has (1,7), but 1 connected to 6? Looking at the edges for 1: (0,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,7). So no edge between 1 and 6. So 1 and 6 are not connected.

Looking at the edges, let's check vertices 0,1,3,5,6. Are they all connected? 0 connected to all except 4, which isn't in this set. 0 is connected to 1,3,5,6. 1 is connected to 3,5 (via edges (1,3), but 1 and 5: wait, does 1 connect to 5? Let's check. Original edges: (1,3), (1,4), (1,6), (1,7). So 1 is not connected to 5. So that's a missing edge. So K5 is not present here.

False edges:
(1, 5) [Manual assessment: N/A]

Another possibility. Maybe 3,5,6 connected to 0,1,2. Let's see:
