Looking at the graph, let's see. For example, vertex 0 is connected to 1,2,3,4,5. So the subgraph induced by 0,1,2,3,4,5 might contain a K5? Let's check. Does any 5 vertices form a complete graph? For example, vertices 0,1,2,5,7: 0 is connected to all except 6 and 7; 1 is connected to 0,2,5,6,7; 2 is connected to 0,1,3,4,6,7; 5 is connected to 0,1,3,4,6,7; 7 is connected to 1,2,3,4,5,6. Wait, maybe a subset like 1,2,5,6,7. Let's see: 1 connected to 2 (yes), 1 to 5 (yes), 1 to 6 (yes), 1 to 7 (yes). 2 connected to 5 (no, edge (2,5) isn't listed. Wait the edges given for 2 are (0,2), (1,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,6), (2,7). So 2 is connected to 0,1,3,4,6,7. So 2 is not connected to 5. So in the subset 1,2,5,6,7, 2 is connected to 1,6,7 but not to 5. So no K5 there.

Wait, maybe this graph contains a complete graph of size 5 (K5), which is non-planar and would require five colors. Let me check if there's a K5 subgraph. For example, vertices 0,1,2,5,7. Let's see: 0 connected to 1,2,5; 1 connected to 0,2,5,7; 2 connected to 0,1,5,7; 5 connected to 0,1,2,7; 7 connected to 1,2,5. Wait, but in K5, every pair must be connected. So 0 is connected to 1,2,5 but not to 7. So 0-7 is not an edge. Therefore, this is not a K5. Similarly, maybe another group. Like 1,2,5,6,7. 1 connected to 2,5,6,7; 2 connected to 1,5,6,7; 5 connected to 1,2,6,7; 6 connected to 1,2,5,7; 7 connected to all. Wait, in this case, 1-2-5-6-7. But 1 and 5 are connected, 1 and 6 are connected, 1 and 7 are connected; 2 and 5, 2 and 6, 2 and 7; 5 and 6, 5 and 7; 6 and 7. But in this subset, each pair is connected except for some. Wait, 1 and 6 are connected, yes. But for K5, every pair must be connected. Let's check: 1 is connected to 2,5,6,7. So 1 is connected to all except 3,4. But in the subset 1,2,5,6,7: 1 is connected to all except maybe 3,4, but 3 and 4 aren't in the subset. Wait, no. In the subset, all nodes are 1,2,5,6,7. So 1 is connected to all in the subset. 2 is connected to 1,5,6,7. 5 is connected to 1,2,6,7. 6 is connected to 1,2,5,7. 7 is connected to all. So in this subset of 5 nodes, every pair is connected except for maybe some? Wait, 1-5: connected. 1-6: connected. 1-7: connected. 2-5: connected. 2-6: connected. 2-7: connected. 5-6: connected. 5-7: connected. 6-7: connected. So actually, all pairs in this subset are connected. So this is a K5. Therefore, the graph contains a K5 subgraph (nodes 1,2,5,6,7). Since K5 is non-planar, the graph is non-planar. Therefore, the four-color theorem doesn't apply here, but in reality, the four-color theorem is for planar graphs, but non-planar graphs might require more colors. However, even non-planar graphs can sometimes be colored with four colors if their chromatic number is less. Wait, the chromatic number is the minimum number of colors needed. The presence of a K5 would mean the chromatic number is at least 5, but if we can color it with four, then the chromatic number is four. Wait, but K5 requires five colors. If the graph contains a K5 subgraph, then its chromatic number is at least 5. Therefore, the graph cannot be colored with four colors. Therefore, the answer should be Impossible.

Take vertices 0,2,3 as one partition. Then, looking for another three vertices that they all connect to. 0 is connected to 1,2,3,4,5,7. 2 is connected to 0,3,4,6,7. 3 is connected to 0,1,2,5,6,7. If we take partition A as 0,2,3, then partition B would need to be three vertices each connected to all of A. Let's see: 4 is connected to 0,2,3 (since 4 is connected to 0,2, but 4 is connected to 3? Wait, no. Edge (3,4) isn't listed. Wait, edge (0,4) is there, (2,4) is there, but (3,4) is not. So 4 is connected to 0 and 2 but not 3. So that's not a complete connection. Similarly, 5 is connected to 0,3 but not 2. 6 is connected to 2,3 but not 0 (since 0 is connected to 6? Wait, 0 is connected to 6? Let me check. The edges for 0: (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,7). So 0 is not connected to 6. So 6 isn't connected to 0. So partition B can't include 6 for A=0,2,3. Similarly, 7 is connected to 0,2,3. So 7 is connected to all three. 4 is connected to 0 and 2, but not 3. 1 is connected to 0 and 3, but not 2. So perhaps if we take B as 4,5,7: 0 is connected to all of them, 2 is connected to 4 and 7, but not 5; 3 is connected to 5 and 7, but not 4. So that's not a K3,3. Hmm. Maybe another set. Let's see.

Wait, vertex 3's edges: (0,3), (1,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7). So vertex 3 is not connected to vertex 2. Wait, wait, that's a mistake.

So vertex 2 is not connected to vertex 3. Therefore, when assigning color to vertex 2, the neighbors are 0 (Yellow), 1 (Yellow), 4 (Green), and 5. But vertex 5 hasn't been colored yet. So vertex 2's color must be different from Yellow, Green, and whatever color 5 is. Wait, but we haven't colored 5 yet. So maybe I need to adjust the order.

Looking at the vertices: Let's see if there's a K5. The complete graph K5 requires 5 vertices each connected to each other. Let's check for any such subset. For example, vertices 0 is connected to 1,3,4,5,6,7. If any five of those form a complete subgraph. Let's check 0,1,4,5,6. Are they all connected to each other? 0 is connected to all. 1 is connected to 0,4. Is 1 connected to 5? No. So 1-5 is not an edge. So no K5 here. Similarly, check other combinations.

The edge list for 4 is (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (4,5), (4,6). So no edge between 4 and 7. Therefore, in the subset 0,4,5,6,7, the edge between 4 and 7 is missing. So that's not a complete graph.

No, 0 is connected to 1, but not 2. So that doesn't work. Hmm. Maybe another way. Let's check the neighbors of 0. 0 is connected to 1,3,4,5,6,7. If I take 0 and look at its neighbors, maybe there's a K3,3 here. But since 0 is connected to 6 nodes, maybe three of them form a partition. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's too time-consuming to check for K5 or K3,3. Since the graph is non-planar, but maybe 4-colorable.

If 6 is Yellow, then 4 and 6 are both Yellow, but they are connected? Let me check: Edge between 4 and 6? Looking back at the edges list. The edges for 4: (0,4), (1,4), (3,4), (4,5), (4,7).

So 5 and 7 would both be Red, but they are connected by an edge (checking edges: (5,7) is not an edge. Wait, looking back at the edge list. Let me check edges involving 5: (0,5), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,6). So 5 is connected to 0,1,2,3,4,6. No edge between 5 and 7. Wait, but vertex 7 is connected to 0,2,3,4,6.

If 0 is Green, then 3,4,6 must be Blue or Yellow. But 3 is connected to 4 and 6. If 3 is Blue, then 4 and 6 can't be Blue. Suppose 4 is Yellow. Then 6 can't be Blue or Yellow (since 6 is connected to 3 (Blue) and 4 (Yellow)), but 6 is a neighbor of 5 (Red), so it can be Green. Wait, but 0 is already Green, and 6 is connected to 0. So 6 can't be Green. So this creates a problem. If 6 is connected to 0 (Green), then 6 can't be Green. Also, 6 is connected to 3 (Blue), so can't be Blue. And connected to 4 (Yellow), so can't be Yellow. Wait, that's a problem. This suggests that coloring 0 as Green leads to a conflict for vertex 6. Therefore, maybe this approach doesn't work.

Looking at the edges: Vertex 2 is connected to 0,1,3,4,6,7. So the neighbors of 2 are 0,1,3,4,6,7. Similarly, vertex 3 is connected to 0,1,2,5,6,7. Vertex 4 is connected to 0,1,2,5,6,7. Vertex 7 is connected to 1,2,3,4,5,6. So, for example, the subgraph induced by vertices 1,2,3,4,7: let's see. 1 is connected to 2,3,4,7. 2 is connected to 1,3,4,7. 3 is connected to 1,2,4,7. 4 is connected to 1,2,3,7. 7 is connected to all of them. So this subgraph is a K5? Wait, 5 vertices each connected to each other. Let me check: in K5, every pair is connected. But in this subgraph, does 1 connect to 7? Yes. 2 connects to all in the subgraph. 3 connects to all. 4 connects to all. 7 connects to all. So yes, this is a complete graph K5. Since K5 is a subgraph, the graph is non-planar. Therefore, the four-color theorem (which applies to planar graphs) doesn't directly apply here. However, non-planar graphs can still sometimes be colored with four colors. For example, the complete graph K4 can be colored with four colors, but K5 would require five. But in our case, the graph contains a K5 as a subgraph. Wait, but if the graph contains a K5, then it would require at least five colors, right? Because in a complete graph of five vertices, each vertex is adjacent to every other, so each must have a unique color. Therefore, if our graph has a K5 subgraph, we need at least five colors. But the problem allows four colors. So that would mean it's impossible. But wait, let me confirm that the subgraph is indeed a K5.

Another approach: let me try to see if the graph contains a complete graph of size 5 (K5) or a complete bipartite graph K3,3, which would make it non-planar. Let's check for K5. A complete graph of 5 nodes would require that every pair of 5 nodes is connected. Looking at the edges, let's see if there are five nodes all connected to each other. Let's check nodes 0,1,2,4,7. Node 0 is connected to 1,2,4 but not to 7. So that's not K5. How about nodes 2,4,5,6,7? Let's see: 2 is connected to 4,5,6,7. 4 is connected to 5,6,7. 5 is connected to 6,7. 6 is connected to 7.

First, maybe I should draw the graph or visualize it. Let's look at the edges. Vertex 0 is connected to 2,3,4,5,6. So vertex 0 has five edges. Then vertex 1 is connected to 2,4,5,6,7. So vertex 1 is also connected to five others. Then vertex 2 is connected to 0,1,3,4,5,6,7—wait, that's seven edges. So vertex 2 is connected to all except maybe itself. Let me count: edges from 2: (0,2), (1,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7). Yes, seven edges. So vertex 2 is connected to every other vertex except maybe itself. Wait, the vertices are 0-7, so 8 vertices. So vertex 2 is connected to 0,1,3,4,5,6,7. That's 7 vertices. So vertex 2 has degree 7. Similarly, let's check vertex 3. Edges with 3: (0,3), (2,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7). That's six edges. So degree 6. Vertex 4: connected to 0,1,2,3,5. Wait, edges (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4). So that's four edges. Wait, wait, let's check again. Edges for 4: (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4). So four edges. Then vertex 5: edges (0,5), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5). So four edges. Vertex 6: edges (0,6), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (6,7). So five edges. Vertex 7: edges (1,7), (2,7), (3,7), (6,7). Four edges.

But vertex 6 is connected to 5 (Yellow). Wait, vertex 5 is Yellow and vertex 6 is connected to vertex 5 (edge (0,5), no. Wait, wait, vertex 6 is connected to 5? Let's check the edges. The edges include (0,6), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (6,7). So vertex 6 is connected to 0,1,2,3,7. Wait, but not to 5. Wait, the original edges list: looking at the original edges, (0,5), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5). So vertex 5 is connected to 0,1,2,3. So vertex 5 is not connected to 6. Therefore, vertex 6 being Yellow is okay even if vertex 5 is Yellow. So vertex 6 is Yellow.

Hmm, vertex 0 is connected to 2,3,4,5,6. So vertex 0 has degree 5. Vertex 1 is connected to 2,4,5,6,7—also degree 5. Vertex 2 is connected to 0,1,3,4,5,6,7—degree 7! That's a lot. Vertex 3 is connected to 0,2,4,5,6,7—degree 6. Vertex 4 is connected to 0,1,2,3,5—degree 5. Vertex 5 is connected to 0,1,2,3,4—degree 5. Vertex 6 is connected to 0,1,2,3,7—degree 5.

But vertex 7's neighbors are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6. However, these vertices might be connected among themselves. For example, vertex 0 is connected to 1,2,3,5,7. So vertex 0 is connected to 1, so they can't have the same color. Similarly, vertex 1 is connected to 0,4,5,6,7. So vertex 1 is connected to 0,4,5,6. So the neighbors of 7 (which are 0-6) form a subgraph. The problem reduces to coloring the subgraph induced by vertices 0-6 such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color, and then assign vertex 7 a color different from each of these. Since vertex 7 is connected to all of them, it needs a color not used by any of 0-6. But since there are four colors, and 0-6 must each be colored with one of the four, but vertex 7 must use the fifth color if all four are used by its neighbors. But since we only have four colors, vertex 7 must have a color that is not used by any of its neighbors. Therefore, the neighbors (0-6) can use at most three colors, leaving the fourth color for vertex 7. Wait, but that's not possible because 0-6 are 7 vertices. If we have to color them with three colors, then by the pigeonhole principle, some color would have to be used at least three times, but since the graph might not allow that. Alternatively, maybe the subgraph of 0-6 can be colored with three colors, but since the original graph is not a 3-colorable graph. Wait, no. Let me think.

But node 0 is Green, and node 2 is connected to node 0 via node 2's edges. Wait, node 2 is connected to node 0? Wait, in the original edges, node 2 is connected to 0 through node 5? Wait, no, node 2 is connected to 0 only via node 5. Wait, in the original graph, node 2 and 0 are connected through the edge (0,5) and (2,5), but not directly. Wait, no. Wait, the original edges list includes (0,1), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7). So node 0 is connected directly to 1,4,5,6,7. There is no direct edge between 0 and 2. Wait, but in the subgraph after removing node 5, node 0 is connected to 1,4,6,7. So node 2 is not connected to node 0 in the subgraph. Therefore, in the subgraph (without node 5), node 0 is connected to 1,4,6,7. So in the subgraph, node 2 is connected to 1,3,4,6,7.

Looking at the vertices, let's see if any 5 vertices are all connected to each other. Let's check vertex 4. It's connected to 0,1,2,5,6,7. So the neighbors of 4 are 0,1,2,5,6,7. Let's see if any five of those form a complete subgraph. For example, 4,5,6,7: 4 is connected to 5,6,7. 5 is connected to 6,7. 6 is connected to 7. So that's a K4 (4,5,6,7). Not a K5. What about 2,3,4,5,7? Vertex 2 is connected to 3,4,5,7. 3 is connected to 4,5,7. 4 is connected to 5,7. 5 is connected to 7. So again, maybe a K4 here. Similarly, other combinations. I don't see a K5 here. So maybe the graph doesn't have a complete graph of five nodes. Therefore, perhaps it can be colored with four colors.

Now, vertex 2 is connected to 0 (Green), 3,4 (Red),5 (Green),7 (Yellow). So 2 can't be Green, Red, or Yellow. So 2 must be Blue. But wait, 2 is connected to 1 (Blue), so they can't be the same. So 2 can't be Blue. That's a problem. So if 0 is Green and 1 is Blue, then 2 has no available color. So this path doesn't work.

Now vertex 4 is Yellow. Then, vertices connected to 4 are 0 (Green), 1 (Blue), 2 (Red), and 6. So vertex 6 is connected to 4 (Yellow), so vertex 6 can't be Yellow. Also, vertex 6 is connected to 0 (Green), 2 (Red), 3,5,7. So vertex 6 can't be Green, Red, or Yellow. Wait, that leaves only Blue. Let me check. Vertex 6's adjacent vertices: 0 (Green), 2 (Red), 3,5,7, and 4 (Yellow). So possible colors for 6: only Blue. Let's assign Blue to vertex 6. But wait, vertex 1 is Blue, and vertex 1 is connected to vertex 6? Let me check the edges. The edge list includes (1,7) and (0,6), but does vertex 1 connect to 6? Looking back at the edges, the edges for vertex 1 are (0,1), (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (1,7). So vertex 1 is not directly connected to 6. So vertex 6 being Blue is okay, as long as none of its adjacent vertices are Blue. Let's check. Vertex 6 is connected to 0 (Green), 2 (Red), 3,4 (Yellow),5,7. So if 6 is Blue, then 3,5,7 can't be Blue. But let's proceed.

Looking for complete subgraphs. Let's see if there's a K4 (complete graph with 4 vertices). For example, vertices 0,1,5,6: 0 connected to 1,5,6; 1 connected to 0,5,6 (but 1 is not connected to 6 directly), so no. How about 0,1,4,5: 0 connected to 1,4,5; 1 connected to 0,4,5; 4 connected to 0,1; 5 connected to 0,1. Not a complete subgraph. How about 5,1,7,6: 1 connected to 5,7; 5 connected to 1,7; 7 connected to 1,5,6; 6 connected to 7. Not a complete subgraph. Maybe 0,4,6: 0 connected to 4,6; 4 connected to 6. So a triangle (K3). Similarly, 5,7,6: 5 connected to 7,6; 7 connected to 6. Not a triangle. 1,5,7: 1 connected to 5,7; 5 connected to 7. That's a triangle. So triangle exists. But 3-coloring can handle triangles.

Wait, the edges given are (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,5). So 4 is not connected to 7. Therefore, vertex 7 is connected to 0,1,2,3,5. So 7 is connected to 0 (Red),1 (Green),2 (Red),3 (Green?),5 (Yellow). So if 3 is Green, then 7 can't be Green, so 7 must be Blue or Yellow. But 7 is connected to 5 (Yellow), so can't be Yellow. Therefore, 7 must be Blue. But 4 is Blue, and 7 is not connected to 4, so that's okay. So 7: Blue.

Looking at vertex 0: connected to 2,3,5,6,7. Are any of these all connected to each other? Let's check 2: 2 is connected to 0,1,3,4,5,7. So 0's neighbors include 2,3,5,6,7. Let's see if 2 is connected to 3,5,6,7. 2 is connected to 3,5,7, but not to 6. So 0's neighbors 2,3,5,6,7: 2 is connected to 3,5,7 but not 6. So maybe 0's neighbors don't form a complete subgraph. Let's check another high-degree vertex. Vertex 5: connected to 0,1,2,3,4,6. Let's see if these form a clique. 0 and 1: not connected. So no, because 0 and 1 are not connected. Similarly, vertex 2 is connected to 0,1,3,4,5,7. Again, 0 and 1 are not connected, so no. So maybe there's no clique larger than 4. Let's check if there's a clique of 4. For example, vertices 2,5,6, maybe others. Let's check 2,5,6,4. 2 is connected to 5,6,4. 5 is connected to 4 and 6. 4 is connected to 6. So yes, 2,4,5,6: each pair is connected except 2 and 6. Wait, 2 is connected to 6? Let me check the edges. Looking back, vertex 2 is connected to 0,1,3,4,5,7. So 2 is not connected to 6. Therefore, 2,4,5,6: 2 is connected to 4 and 5 but not 6. So that's not a clique. How about 5,6,4,7? 5 is connected to 6,4, but not to 7. 6 is connected to 4 and 7. 4 is connected to 7. So 4,5,6,7: 5 and 7 are not connected, so not a clique. How about 0,2,3,5? 0 is connected to 2,3,5. 2 is connected to 3 and 5. 3 is connected to 5. So that's a clique of size 4: 0,2,3,5. Because each is connected to the others. Wait, 0 is connected to 2,3,5. 2 is connected to 0,3,5. 3 is connected to 0,2,5. 5 is connected to 0,2,3. So yes, that's a complete subgraph of 4 nodes. Therefore, this requires 4 different colors for each of those four vertices. So that's a 4-clique, which means that we need at least 4 colors. Since we have four colors, maybe it's possible. But let's check if the entire graph is 4-colorable.

Let me backtrack. Maybe the order in which I assigned colors to 2,5,6 is causing this conflict. Let me try a different approach. Let's start with vertex 5. Assign Red. Then vertex 2 is adjacent to 5, so can't be Red. Assign Blue. Vertex 6 is adjacent to 5 (Red) and 2 (Blue), so assign Green. Then vertex 0 is connected to 2 (Blue),5 (Red),6 (Green), so must be Yellow. Vertex 7 is connected to 0 (Yellow), 2 (Blue),4,6 (Green). So 7 can't be Yellow, Blue, or Green. Assign Red. Now, vertex 1 is connected to 2 (Blue),4,5 (Red),6 (Green). So 1 can't be Blue, Red, Green. Assign Yellow. Then vertex 4 is connected to 1 (Yellow),2 (Blue),5 (Red),6 (Green),7 (Red). So the available colors for 4: it can't be Yellow, Blue, Red, or Green. Again, no color left. Same problem.

But let me check if that forms K3,3. 0 is connected to 3,4,5. 1 is connected to 3. 2 is connected to 3. So that's not all edges. Not K3,3. How about another partition? Maybe {0,1,7} and {2,3,6}. Let's see. 0 connected to 2,3,6. 1 connected to 2,3,6. 7 connected to 2,3,6? 7 is connected to 2 and 3 and 6. Wait, 7 is connected to 2, yes. 7 is connected to 3? Wait, looking at edges: (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). Wait, 7 is connected to 3? Wait, original edges: (3,4), (3,5). So 7 is connected to 0,1,2,4,5,6. So 7 is not connected to 3. So the partition {0,1,7} and {2,3,6} would have 0 connected to 2,3,6; 1 connected to 2,3,6; 7 connected to 2,6. But 7 isn't connected to 3, and 0,1,7 aren't connected to all of 2,3,6.

Hmm, vertex 0 is connected to 1,2,3,6,7. That's five neighbors. Similarly, vertex 2 is connected to 0,3,4,5,6,7 – six neighbors. Vertex 1 is connected to 0,5,6,7 – four neighbors. Vertex 3 is connected to 0,2,4,6,7 – five neighbors. Vertex 4 is connected to 2,3,5,7 – four neighbors. Vertex 5 is connected to 1,2,4,6,7 – five neighbors. Vertex 6 is connected to 0,1,2,3,5,7 – six neighbors. Vertex 7 is connected to 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 – seven neighbors. Wait, vertex 7 is connected to almost everyone except maybe itself? Let me check again. From the edges listed: (0,7), (1,7), (2,7), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7), (6,7). So yes, vertex 7 is connected to all other vertices except itself. That's a problem because vertex 7 has seven neighbors, each of which must be colored differently. But since we have four colors, this might not be possible unless... Wait, vertex 7 is connected to all other seven vertices. Wait, but there are only eight vertices total. So vertex 7 is connected to 0,1,2,3,4,5,6. So seven neighbors. So each of those seven neighbors must have a different color than vertex 7. But since there are four colors, the neighbors can each take one of the three other colors. However, the problem is that vertex 7 is connected to all seven other nodes, so all seven must be colored with the remaining three colors. But since there are only three other colors (since vertex 7 uses one), and each of the seven neighbors must have a different color from vertex 7 and from each other. Wait, but three colors can only color at most three nodes without repeating. Wait, no, actually, the neighbors just need to have a color different from vertex 7, but they can share colors among themselves as long as they are not adjacent. Wait, but in this case, the neighbors of vertex 7 (which are all other nodes) are connected to each other as well. For example, vertex 0 is connected to 1,2,3,6,7. So vertex 0 can't be the same color as 1,2,3,6, or 7. But vertex 1 is connected to 0,5,6,7. So vertex 1 can't be the same as 0,5,6,7. Wait, but if vertex 7 is colored with color A, then all other nodes (0-6) must be colored with B, C, D. However, since they are all connected to 7, their colors must be among B, C, D. But since they are also connected to each other, we need to assign colors such that adjacent nodes don't share the same color. However, since many of these nodes are connected to each other, it might require more than three colors for their mutual adjacencies. But since we only have three colors available (since one is used for vertex 7), this might not be possible. For example, if vertex 7 is red, then all other nodes must be green, blue, or yellow. But if among those nodes, there's a clique that requires more than three colors, then it's impossible. Wait, but the four-color theorem says that any planar graph can be colored with four colors. But wait, first, is this graph planar? Because if it's planar, then four colors would suffice. But if it's not planar, maybe it's a different case. Wait, vertex 7 is connected to all others. Let me think: if vertex 7 is connected to all others, then the graph contains a K8 subgraph? Wait, no. K8 would have all vertices connected to each other, but here, vertex 7 is connected to all others, but the other vertices aren't necessarily connected to each other. However, even so, the presence of a vertex connected to all others might affect planarity. But maybe the graph isn't planar. Let me check for planarity. A graph is planar if it can be drawn in the plane without edge crossings. According to Kuratowski's theorem, a graph is non-planar if it contains a subgraph that is a complete graph K5 or a complete bipartite graph K3,3. Let's see if this graph contains K5. Let's check if any five vertices are all connected to each other. For example, vertices 0,1,2,3,7: 0 is connected to 1,2,3,7. 1 is connected to 0,2,5,6,7. Wait, 1 is connected to 0,5,6,7, but not to 2? Wait, the edges: (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,6), (0,7), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,4), (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (4,7), (5,6), (5,7). So 1 is connected to 0,5,6,7. Wait, no edge between 1 and 2. So in the subset 0,1,2,3,7: 0 is connected to 1,2,3,7; 1 is connected to 0,5,6,7 but not to 2 or 3 (except through 0). So that's not a complete K5. Similarly, checking other subsets. Maybe looking for K3,3. Let's see. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to check planarity via Euler's formula. For a planar graph, the number of edges must satisfy E ≤ 3V - 6. Here, V=8, so 3*8 -6 = 18 edges. Let's count the edges given. The edges are listed as 20 edges. So 20 edges compared to 18. So if the graph is planar, it would require E ≤ 18. But since we have 20 edges, which is more than 18, the graph is non-planar. Therefore, the four-color theorem doesn't apply here. Wait, but the four-color theorem is for planar graphs. So if the graph is non-planar, it can require more than four colors? Wait, no. The four-color theorem is specific to planar graphs. For non-planar graphs, the chromatic number can be higher. For example, a complete graph with n nodes has chromatic number n. So if the graph contains a complete graph of 5 nodes, then it would require at least 5 colors. But in our case, since vertex 7 is connected to all others, but the others aren't all connected to each other. However, if the subgraph induced by the neighbors of 7 (which are 0-6) is such that they form a clique, then that would require a high chromatic number. But let's check. The neighbors of 7 are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6. Let's look at the edges between these nodes. For example, 0 is connected to 1,2,3,6. 1 is connected to 0,5,6. 2 is connected to 0,3,4,5,6. 3 is connected to 0,2,4,6. 4 is connected to 2,3,5. 5 is connected to 1,2,4,6. 6 is connected to 0,1,2,3,5. So this subgraph (excluding 7) is quite connected. Let me see if there's a K4 here. For example, consider nodes 0,2,3,6. 0 is connected to 2,3,6. 2 is connected to 0,3,6. 3 is connected to 0,2,6. 6 is connected to 0,2,3. So that's a K4 (complete graph on 4 nodes). Therefore, the subgraph induced by 0,2,3,6 is a K4. Therefore, the chromatic number of the subgraph is at least 4. But since we have three colors available (since vertex 7 is using one), this would require that the subgraph (neighbors of 7) can be colored with three colors. But since the subgraph contains a K4, which requires 4 colors, this is impossible. Therefore, the entire graph cannot be colored with 4 colors. Wait, but the four-color theorem applies to planar graphs, but since this graph is non-planar, maybe it requires more than four colors. However, the problem allows four colors. But according to this reasoning, since the neighbors of vertex 7 form a subgraph that includes a K4, which requires 4 colors, but vertex 7 is colored with color A, then the neighbors need to be colored with B, C, D. However, the K4 in the neighbors would require 4 different colors, which we don't have because we can only use B, C, D. Therefore, this would make the coloring impossible. Therefore, the graph cannot be colored with four colors. Therefore, the answer should be "Impossible".

0 is connected to 1, 2, 3, 6, 7. So vertex 0 has degree 5. That's quite a lot. Then vertex 1 is connected to 0,5,6,7. So degree 4. Vertex 2 is connected to 0,3,4,5,6,7. That's degree 6! Wow, vertex 2 is really connected. Vertex 3 is connected to 0,2,4,6,7. So degree 5. Vertex 4 is connected to 2,3,5,7. Degree 4. Vertex 5 is connected to 1,2,4,6,7. Degree 5. Vertex 6 is connected to 0,1,2,3,5,7. Degree 6. Vertex 7 is connected to 0,1,2,3,4,5,6. Wait, that's 7 edges—degree 7! So vertex 7 is connected to every other vertex except itself. Wait, but the graph is undirected, so yes, vertex 7 is connected to all others except itself. Wait, check that: the edges for 7 are (0,7), (1,7), (2,7), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7), (6,7). So yes, vertex 7 is connected to every other vertex. That's a key point. So vertex 7 is adjacent to 0,1,2,3,4,5,6. So if vertex 7 is connected to all others, then in any coloring, vertex 7 must have a color different from all the other 7 vertices. But we only have four colors. Wait, but the other vertices are 0 through 6, which are 7 vertices. But if vertex 7 is connected to all of them, then each of those 7 vertices must have a different color from vertex 7, but since there are 7 vertices and only 3 remaining colors (since one color is used by vertex 7), that might be a problem. Wait, but wait, no. The four colors are red, green, blue, yellow. So vertex 7 can take one color, say red. Then each of the other 7 vertices (0-6) must be colored with green, blue, or yellow. But if any of those 7 vertices are adjacent to each other, their colors can be same or different as long as they're not the same as their neighbors. Wait, but the problem is that in order for vertex 7 to be connected to all others, each of the other vertices must not be red. But we have four colors, so the remaining vertices can be green, blue, yellow. But if the subgraph induced by vertices 0-6 can be colored with three colors, then it's possible. But since the original graph requires four colors, maybe this is possible. Wait, but wait, the graph might not be 3-colorable. Let me check.

Are all these connected? 0 is connected to 1,5,6,7. 1 is connected to 5, 0,6 (no, 1 isn't connected to 7? Wait, yes, vertex 1 is connected to 7. So 0,1,5,6,7: 0 is connected to 1,5,6,7; 1 is connected to 0,5,7; 5 is connected to all; 6 is connected to 0,5,7; 7 is connected to 0,1,5,6. But in this group, 1 is not connected to 6, and 6 is not connected to 1. Similarly, 1 is connected to 0,5,7 but not to 6. So that's not a complete subgraph. How about 5,1,2,3,6? 5 is connected to 1,2,3,6. 1 is connected to 2 and 3. 2 is connected to 3 and 6. 3 is connected to 6. So let's see the connections: 5-1,5-2,5-3,5-6; 1-2,1-3; 2-3,2-6; 3-6. So missing edges between 1 and 6, 1 and 5 is connected to all. Not a complete graph. So no K5 here, maybe. So maybe the graph is planar. If it's planar, then four colors should suffice. But maybe it's not planar. Wait, another way to check planarity is using Euler's formula: for planar graphs, edges ≤ 3n - 6, where n is the number of vertices. Here, n=8, so 3*8 -6= 18. Let's count the edges: The edge list given has 20 edges. Wait, that's more than 18. So if the graph has 20 edges and 8 vertices, then according to Euler's formula, if it were planar, it should have at most 18 edges. Since it has 20, it's not planar. Therefore, the four-color theorem doesn't necessarily apply here. Wait, but wait, the four-color theorem applies to planar graphs. If the graph is non-planar, it might still be 4-colorable, but the theorem doesn't guarantee it. So maybe this graph is 4-colorable, maybe not. Hmm.

But vertex 6 is also connected to 0 (red), so it's already not red. So possible colors for 6: green, blue, yellow. But 6 is connected to 2 (green), 3 (blue), 4 (green). So green is out.

Is vertex 7 connected to any blue nodes? Vertex 7 is connected to 2 (green), 3 (blue). Wait, vertex 3 is blue. So vertex 7 is connected to 3, which is blue. So vertex 7 can't be blue. Oh no, that's a problem. So vertex 7 can't be red (connected to 0,1), green (connected to 2,4), yellow (connected to 5). And blue is connected to 3. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let's verify: vertex 7's neighbors are 0,1,2,4,5. So 0 and 1 are red, 2 and 4 are green, 5 is yellow. So none of the neighbors of 7 are blue except maybe 3? Wait, no. Vertex 7 is connected to 3? Let me check the original edges again. Looking at the edge list: edges for vertex 7 are (0,7), (1,7), (2,7), (4,7), (5,7). So vertex 7 is connected to vertices 0,1,2,4,5. So vertex 3 is not a neighbor of 7. Wait, then where did I get that vertex 7 is connected to 3? Maybe I confused with another edge. So vertex 7 is not connected to 3. Then vertex 7's neighbors are 0 (red),1 (red),2 (green),4 (green),5 (yellow). Therefore, the colors used by its neighbors are red, green, yellow. So blue is available. So vertex 7 can be blue. So assign blue to 7. Then check if blue is okay. Since vertex 7 is connected to 3? No, 7 isn't connected to 3. So that's okay. So vertex 7 is blue.

Wait, planar graphs cannot have a subgraph that is a complete graph of 5 nodes (K5). Let's check if there's a K5 subgraph here.

Another possible partition. Or maybe 1,5,6 and 3,4,7? Let's see: 1 connects to 3,4,5,6,7. So 1 is connected to all in the second partition. 5 connects to 3,4,7. 6 connects to 3,7. So maybe not. Alternatively, maybe 1,2,5 and 3,6,7. 1 connects to 3,6,7. 2 connects to 6,7. 5 connects to 3,6,7. Hmm, not exactly each node in the first partition connected to all in the second. So perhaps there's no K3,3 subdivision. So maybe the graph is planar. If it's planar, then four colors should suffice. But I need to confirm.

Now, vertex 4 is connected to 1 (Blue), 3 (Yellow),5,6 (Blue),7 (Green). So 4 can't be Blue, Yellow, or Green. Wait, since vertex 4 is connected to 7 (Green), 3 (Yellow), and 1 (Blue). So 4 can't be Green, Yellow, Blue. So the only color left is Red. Assign Red to vertex 4. Then neighbors of 4 (1,3,5,6,7) can't be Red. But 1 is Blue, 3 is Yellow, 5 is next, 6 is Blue, 7 is Green. So vertex 5, which is connected to 0 (Red),1 (Blue),3 (Yellow),4 (Red). So 5 can't be Red, Blue, Yellow. So the only color left is Green. Assign Green to vertex 5. But wait, vertex 5 is connected to 0 (Red), which is okay, and 1 (Blue), which is okay, 3 (Yellow), which is okay, and 4 (Red), which is okay. Also, vertex 5 is connected to 7 (Green).

Looking back at the edges: (0,5), (1,5), (3,5), (4,5). So vertex 5 is connected to 0,1,3,4. Not 7. So vertex 5 is not connected to 7. So assigning Green to 5 is okay because 5 is connected to 0 (Red),1 (Blue),3 (Yellow),4 (Red). Green is available. So vertex 5 can be Green. Wait, but wait, if vertex 5 is Green, then it's adjacent to vertex 1 (Blue) and vertex 4 (Red), which is fine. Vertex 0 is Red, so no problem. So yes, Green is okay.

Looking at the edges, let's check if there's a K5 subgraph. A K5 would require 5 nodes each connected to every other. Let's look at node 3. It's connected to nodes 0,1,2,5,6,7. If any five of those form a complete subgraph. Let's check 3,0,1,6,7. Node 0 is connected to 3,1,6,7 (but not to 2,5). So in this group: 3 connected to all, 0 connected to 1,6,7 but not to others. 1 connected to 0,3,6,7. Wait, node 0 and 1 are connected, 0 and 6 are connected, 0 and 7 are connected. 1 and 6? Let's check: edge (1,6) isn't listed. Wait, looking back at the edges: (0,6), (1,7), (2,6), (3,6), etc. Hmm, node 1 is connected to 0,3,4,5,7. So 1 is not connected to 6. Therefore, the group 3,0,1,6,7 isn't a complete subgraph because 1 isn't connected to 6. Similarly, maybe another group. Let's check 3,6,7,0,2? Node 3 is connected to all, 6 is connected to 0,2,3,4,5,7. 7 is connected to 0,1,2,3,4,6. So 6 is connected to 0,2,3,4,5,7. So in this group, 0 is connected to 3,6,7, but 0 isn't connected to 2. Similarly, 2 is connected to 3,5,6,7. So maybe 3,6,7,2,5: 3 connected to all, 6 connected to 3,5,7,2; 7 connected to 3,6,2; 5 connected to 3,2,6. Wait, node 5 is connected to 3,2,6, but not to 7. So 5 is not connected to 7. So that's not a complete subgraph either. Similarly, other combinations. It seems there's no K5 subgraph. How about K3,3? Let's see. A bipartition of 3 and 3 nodes. For example, maybe nodes 3,6,7 and 0,1,2. Let's check if each in the first group is connected to all in the second. 3 is connected to 0,1,2. 6 is connected to 0,2. 7 is connected to 0,1,2. So 6 isn't connected to 1. So that's not K3,3. Another possible bipartition: maybe 3,5,6 and 0,1,7. 3 connected to 0,1,7 (yes), 5 connected to 1 (and 0? No, 5 is connected to 1,2,3,6. So 5 isn't connected to 0,7. So no. So maybe the graph is planar? If it is planar, then by the four-color theorem, it can be colored with four colors. But perhaps it's non-planar, but even if it is, since we have four colors, maybe it's possible. Wait, four-color theorem applies to planar graphs, but non-planar graphs might require more colors. But since the question allows four colors, maybe even if it's non-planar, perhaps it's possible to color it with four. For example, complete graphs require n colors. So if there's a K5, which needs 5 colors. But since we don't have K5 here, maybe 4 is enough.

- 6 is connected to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7. Degree 7! Wow, vertex 6 is connected to everyone except maybe itself? Let me check. The edges listed for 6: (0,6), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,7). Yes, that's 7 edges. So vertex 6 is connected to all other vertices except itself. Wait, but in an undirected graph, a vertex can't connect to itself. So vertex 6 is connected to every other vertex. That makes it a hub. That's going to be important because in coloring, vertex 6 must have a color different from all others. Since there are 7 adjacent vertices, but we only have 4 colors, but since each adjacent vertex can share colors among themselves as long as they aren't adjacent. Wait, but vertex 6 is adjacent to all others, so each of the other 7 vertices must have a color different from vertex 6. However, since there are 4 colors, vertex 6 uses one color, and the other 7 vertices must use the remaining 3 colors. But since each of those 7 can't have the same color as vertex 6, but they can have the same color as each other if they aren't connected. But wait, the problem is that vertex 6 is connected to all others, but the other vertices are also connected among themselves. So for example, vertex 0 is connected to 1,2,4,5,6. So vertex 0 can't be the same color as 1,2,4,5,6, but since 6 is already a different color, 0's color just needs to be different from 1,2,4,5 and 6. But since 1,2,4,5 are neighbors of 0, they can't share the same color as 0. But since the graph is complex, maybe there's a way to assign colors such that each of the 7 neighbors of 6 are colored with the remaining three colors. But wait, 7 vertices and 3 colors... but that would require some colors to be used multiple times. However, since the graph's structure might allow for that. Let's see.

Wait, so in this subset, if 0 is connected to 1,2,4 but not to 3, so 0 isn't connected to 3. So the subset 0,1,2,3,4 doesn't form a K5. How about another subset?

So not a complete graph. So maybe there's no K5. How about K3,3? Let's see. K3,3 is a bipartite graph with each partition having three nodes, and all edges between them. Let's see if such a subgraph exists. For example, maybe the vertices 0,1,2 as one partition and 3,4,5 as the other? Let's check if each in the first is connected to each in the second. 0 connected to 3? No. 0 is connected to 1,2,4,6. So 0 is connected to 4 in the second partition. But not to 3 or 5. So no. How about another subset. Maybe 1,2,3 and 4,5,6? Check if each in the first is connected to each in the second. 1 is connected to 4,5,6. 2 is connected to 4,6,7 (but 7 is not in the partitions). 3 is connected to 4,5,6. So 1 is connected to 4,5,6. 2 is connected to 4 and 6. 3 is connected to 4,5,6. So in the second partition (4,5,6), each in the first (1,2,3) would need to connect to all in the second. But 2 isn't connected to 5. So no. Hmm. Maybe another set. Let's see. Alternatively, maybe 1,2,6 and 3,4,5. Let's check. 1 connected to 3 (yes), 4 (yes), 5 (yes). 2 connected to 3 (yes), 4 (yes), 5 (no, 2 is not connected to 5). 6 connected to 3 (yes), 4 (no), 5 (yes). So no, since 2 isn't connected to 5 and 6 isn't connected to 4. So perhaps this graph isn't K3,3. Maybe it's planar. If it's planar, four colors would suffice. But if it's not planar, maybe it's still 4-colorable. Because non-planar graphs can sometimes be colored with four colors. The four-color theorem is specifically about planar graphs, but other graphs might require more. Wait, but in general, any graph with chromatic number greater than four would have a non-planar component or something else. But maybe this graph is 4-colorable.

Assign vertex 4 a color, say Red. Then its neighbors 0,1,2,3,5,7 cannot be Red. Then let's look at another high-degree vertex. Vertex 3 is connected to 1,2,4,5,6. Let's pick Green for vertex 3. Now, vertex 3 is Green. Then vertex 1 is connected to 3 (Green), 4 (Red), 6,7. Let's assign Blue to vertex 1. Now, vertex 1 is Blue. Then vertex 2 is connected to 3 (Green), 4 (Red),5,6. Let's assign Yellow to vertex 2. Now, vertex 2 is Yellow. Then vertex 5 is connected to 0,2 (Yellow),3 (Green),4 (Red),6,7. So vertex 5's neighbors are 0 (unknown yet), 2 (Y), 3 (G),4 (R),6,7. Let's assign Blue to vertex 5, assuming 0's color isn't Blue. Then vertex 0 is connected to 4 (Red),5 (Blue),6,7. So vertex 0 can be Green or Yellow. Let's pick Green. Then vertex 0 is Green. Then vertex 6 is connected to 0 (G),1 (B),2 (Y),3 (G),4 (R),5 (B),7. So 6's neighbors are G, B, Y, G, R, B. So the colors used on its neighbors are G, B, Y, R. So all four colors are taken.

Looking at vertex 0: connected to 4,5,6,7. So 0 is connected to four others. Vertex 4 is connected to 0,1,2,3,5,7. So 4 is connected to six vertices. 5 is connected to 0,2,3,4,6,7. So 5 is connected to 0,2,3,4,6,7. Let's see if there's a K5 subgraph. For example, take vertices 0,4,5,6,7. Let's check if they form a complete graph. 0 is connected to all of them. 4 is connected to 0,5,6,7. But 4 isn't connected to itself. Wait, but 4 is connected to 5,6,7. So between 4,5,6,7: 4-5, 4-6, 4-7. 5-6,5-7. 6-7. So that's all the edges except maybe 5-6, which is present. Wait, edges between 5 and 6? Yes, (5,6) is in the edge list. So 4,5,6,7 form a complete graph K4. But 0 is connected to all four of them, so 0 plus 4,5,6,7 would form a K5 if all the edges between them are present. Let's check. 0 is connected to 4,5,6,7. But does 4 connect to 5? Yes. 4 to 6? Yes. 4 to 7? Yes. 5 to 6? Yes. 5 to 7? Yes. 6 to 7? Yes. So in the subgraph of 0,4,5,6,7, every pair is connected except maybe between 0 and other nodes besides 4,5,6,7. Wait, but within the subset {0,4,5,6,7}, each node is connected to every other node. So that's a K5. Because each of the five nodes is connected to the other four. So this graph contains a K5, which is non-planar. Therefore, the four-color theorem applies to planar graphs, but if the graph is non-planar, maybe it's still 4-colorable? Wait, the four-color theorem says that any planar graph is 4-colorable, but non-planar graphs can also sometimes be 4-colorable. For example, K5 is 5-chromatic, so it requires 5 colors. But since this graph contains a K5 subgraph, then the chromatic number is at least 5. But wait, we only have four colors. So does that mean it's impossible to color it with four colors? But wait, let me confirm: K5 requires five colors. But if the graph has a K5 subgraph, then the entire graph's chromatic number is at least 5, which would mean that four colors are insufficient. Therefore, the answer might be impossible. But wait, wait, maybe the subgraph isn't a K5. Let me check again.

Let's see. 3 connected to 4: yes. 3 to 5: yes. 3 to 6: yes. 3 to 7: no. 4 connected to 5: yes. 4 to 6: yes. 4 to 7: yes. 5 to 6: no. 5 to 7: yes. 6 to 7: yes. So not a complete graph.

Alternative approach: Let's try a different color for vertex 5. Suppose after vertex 3 is Red, we assign vertex 5 to Blue instead of Green. Then, vertex 5's neighbors (0,1,2,3,4,7) can't be Blue. Now, vertex 6 is connected to 3 (Red) and 5 (Blue). So it can be Green or Yellow. Let's choose Green for vertex 6. Now, vertex 6's neighbors (0,1,2,3,4,7) can't be Green.

Looking at the edges, let's see if there's a K5. Let's check if any 5 vertices are all connected to each other. Let's see: vertices 0,1,2,5,7. Let's check their connections. 0 is connected to 1,2,5,7. 1 is connected to 0,2,5,7 (since 1 is connected to 0,2, but 1 is not connected to 5? Wait, looking back at the edges, 1 is connected to 5? Wait, in the initial edge list, 1 is connected to 0,2,3,4,6,7. So 1 is not connected to 5. So the edge between 1 and 5 is not present. So 0 is connected to 5, but 1 is not. So the subgraph 0,1,2,5,7: 0 is connected to all except maybe 1? Wait, 0 is connected to 1,2,5,7. 1 is connected to 0,2,7 but not 5. 2 is connected to 0,1,5,7. 5 is connected to 0,2,4,6,7. 7 is connected to 0,1,2,4,5,6. So in this group, 0 is connected to 1,2,5,7. 1 is connected to 0,2,7. 2 is connected to 0,1,5,7. 5 is connected to 0,2,7. 7 is connected to 0,1,2,5. So there's no K5 here. Because for K5, every pair should be connected. But here, 1 and 5 are not connected, 5 and 1 are not connected. So no K5. Similarly, maybe check another group. How about vertices 0,1,3,6,7? Let's see: 0 is connected to 1,3,6,7. 1 is connected to 0,3,6,7. 3 is connected to 0,1,6. 6 is connected to 0,1,3,5,7. 7 is connected to 0,1,6.

Starting with vertex 0: it's connected to 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7. That's a lot of connections—six edges. So vertex 0 has degree 6. That might be important because it's connected to almost all other vertices except maybe vertex 4. Let me check the edges for vertex 4. The edges involving 4 are (1,4), (3,4), (4,5), (4,7). So vertex 4 is connected to 1, 3, 5, 7. So vertex 0 isn't connected to 4. Interesting. So the graph might have two main hubs: vertex 0 and vertex 1. Let's check vertex 1's connections: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7. That's six edges as well. So both 0 and 1 have degree 6. Then vertex 2: connected to 0,1,5,7. Degree 4. Vertex 3: connected to 0,1,4,6. Degree 4. Vertex 4: connected to 1,3,5,7. Degree 4. Vertex 5: connected to 0,2,4,6,7. Degree 5. Vertex 6: connected to 0,1,3,5,7. Degree 5. Vertex 7: connected to 0,1,2,4,5,6. Degree 6.

Now, let's handle these vertices. Let's start with vertex 1. It's connected to 0 (Red) and 3 (Green). So possible colors: Blue or Yellow. Let's pick Blue for vertex 1.

So vertex 6 is Yellow. Now, vertex 2 is connected to 0 (Red), 3 (Green), and 6 (Yellow). So vertex 2 can be Blue. Let's assign vertex 2 to Blue. Then, vertex 7 is connected to 0 (Red), 3 (Green), 2 (Blue), and 5. So vertex 7 can't be Red, Green, or Blue, so it must be Yellow. Assign vertex 7 to Yellow. Now, vertex 5 is connected to 0 (Red), 3 (Green), 4, and 7 (Yellow). So vertex 5 can't be Red, Green, or Yellow, so it must be Blue. Assign vertex 5 to Blue. Now, vertex 4 is connected to 1 (Blue), 3 (Green), and 5 (Blue). Wait, vertex 4 is connected to 5 (Blue), so it can't be Blue. It's connected to 1 (Blue) and 3 (Green).

So 3 can't be red or green. Let's assign Blue. Then vertex 2 is connected to 0 (red), 3 (blue), 6,7. So vertex 2 can't be red or blue. Let's choose Green.

But vertex 1 is Red, and vertex 2 is connected to vertex 1. Wait, no. Wait, vertex 2 is connected to 0,3,4,5,6,7. Wait, is vertex 2 connected to 1? Let me check the edges again. The edges for vertex 2 are (0,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7). So 2 is not connected to 1. Therefore, vertex 2 is not adjacent to 1, so if 1 is Red, 2 can be Red. Wait, but in the previous step, I thought 2 must be Red because of its other neighbors. Wait, let's correct that. So vertex 2 is connected to 0,3,4,5,6,7. So 4 is Green, 5 is Blue, 7 is Yellow. So 2 cannot be Green, Blue, or Yellow. Also, connected to 0, which is either Blue or Yellow. So if 0 is Blue, then 2 can't be Blue. Then 2's possible colors: Red or Yellow. But 7 is Yellow, which is connected to 2, so 2 can't be Yellow. Hence, if 0 is Blue, 2 must be Red. If 0 is Yellow, then 2 can't be Yellow. Then, 2's possible colors: Red, Blue. But 5 is Blue, connected to 2, so 2 can't be Blue. So again, only Red. So regardless of 0's color, 2 must be Red. And since 2 is not connected to 1, that's okay. So 2: Red.

Wait, vertex 3's edges are (1,3), (2,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7). So vertex 3 is not directly connected to 0. So vertex 3 can be colored Red, since it's not adjacent to 0. Wait, is that right?

Looking at vertex 0: connected to all others. So if we take vertex 0 and any four other vertices, that would form a K5. Wait, no. K5 is a complete graph where every pair is connected. So if 0 is connected to 1,2,3,4,5,6,7. But for K5, we need 5 vertices where each is connected to every other. Let's see. Suppose we take 0,1,2,3,4. Is that a K5? 0 is connected to all, but 1 is connected to 0,4,6. So 1 is not connected to 2,3,5,7. So 1 and 2 are not connected. Therefore, 0,1,2,3,4 is not a K5. Similarly, take 0,2,4,6,7. 0 is connected to all, but 2 is connected to 4,5,6,7,3. So in this subset, 2 is connected to 4,6,7. 4 is connected to 0,2,6,7 (and others). 6 is connected to 0,2,4,7. 7 is connected to 0,2,4,6. So in this subset, 0 is connected to all, 2 is connected to 4,6,7, but not to 0 (wait, 2 is connected to 0).

Wait, 4 and 7 are connected. So in this subset, every pair is connected. So that's a complete graph K5. So 0,2,4,6,7 form a K5. Therefore, this graph contains a K5 subgraph, which requires 5 colors.

Now, vertex 3 is connected to 0 (Red) and 1 (Red). So it can't be Red. Let's assign Green. Wait, but vertex 3 is connected to vertex 2 (Green), so if I make vertex 3 Green, that's a conflict. So vertex 3 can't be Green. So let's pick Blue.

Looking at the edges, let's see if there's a K5. For example, vertices 0,1,2,3,7: 0 is connected to all except maybe each other. Let's check if 0,1,2,3,7 form a K5. 0 is connected to all. 1 is connected to 0,2,3,7. 2 is connected to 0,1,3,7. 3 is connected to 0,1,2,7. 7 is connected to 0,1,2,3. Wait, but in K5, every pair must be connected. Let's check between 1 and 2: yes. 1 and 3: yes. 1 and 7: yes. 2 and 3: yes. 2 and 7: yes. 3 and 7: yes. So 0 is connected to all, but the other four (1,2,3,7) form a K4 among themselves. Wait, 1,2,3,7 each connected to each other? Let's check. 1-2: yes. 1-3: yes. 1-7: yes. 2-3: yes. 2-7: yes. 3-7: yes. So that's a K4. But K5 requires 5 vertices all connected. So 0 is connected to 1,2,3,7. But does 0 connect to all those? Yes, except maybe 0 isn't connected to 7? Wait, no, 0 is connected to 7 (given in the edges). Wait, the edges include (0,7). So 0 is connected to 1,2,3,4,7. So the group 0,1,2,3,7: 0 is connected to all except 4, which isn't in the group. Wait, but in that group, 1 is connected to 0,2,3,7. So 0 is connected to 1,2,3,7. So in that set, the edges between the five nodes: 0 is connected to 1,2,3,7. Then 1 is connected to 2,3,7. 2 is connected to 3,7. 3 is connected to 7. But 1 is not connected to 0 in this group? Wait, no, 0 is connected to 1.

So, 1 connected to 3,4,5,7; 3 connected to 1,4,5; but 3 is not connected to 7. 4 is connected to 1,3,5,7. 5 connected to 1,3,4,7. 7 connected to 1,4,5. So, missing edges between 3 and 7, and 3 and 7. So not a K5. Maybe there's no K5 here. So the graph might be planar? Or maybe not. But regardless, since the four-color theorem applies to planar graphs, if it's planar, then four colors suffice. If it's non-planar, maybe four colors still suffice. Alternatively, maybe it's impossible. Let's try to color it step by step.

Vertex 1: connected to 0 (Yellow) and 5 is connected via 0, but wait, 1 is connected to 0 (Yellow). Also, 1 is connected to 3,6,7. So 6 is Green, 7 is Blue. So 1 can't be Yellow, Green, Blue. So possible color: Red. But wait, check if Red is used by adjacent vertices. 1 is connected to 5 (Red), so can't use Red. So that's a problem. Wait, vertex 1 is connected to 0 (Yellow), 5 is not adjacent to 1. Wait, wait: vertex 1's edges are (0,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,6), (1,7). So 1 is connected to 0,2,3,6,7. So 1 is not connected to 5. Therefore, vertex 5's color is Red, but 1 isn't adjacent to 5. So when coloring vertex 1, the adjacent colors are 0 (Yellow), 6 (Green), 7 (Blue). So 1 cannot be Yellow, Green, Blue. So the remaining color is Red. Wait, but Red is not used by any of 1's neighbors. Because 1's neighbors are 0 (Yellow), 2 (not yet colored), 3 (not yet), 6 (Green), 7 (Blue). So yes, 1 can be Red. Assign Red to 1.

Looking at the edges, let's check if any 5 vertices form a complete subgraph. Let's start with vertex 7. Since it's connected to all others, any clique that includes 7 would need the other vertices to be connected to each other. Let's check vertices 0,1,3,7. For example, 0 is connected to 1,3 (0 is connected to 1, but 0 is not connected to 3. Wait, edges of 0: 0 is connected to 1,2,5,6,7. So 0 is not connected to 3. So a clique containing 0 and 3 would require an edge between them, which doesn't exist. How about vertex 1: connected to 3,4,5,7. Let's check if 1,3,4,5,7 form a clique. 1 is connected to 3,4,5,7. Then 3 is connected to 1,4,5,7. 4 is connected to 1,3,5,7? Let's check. 4's edges: 1,2,3,6,7. So 4 is connected to 1,3,7, but not to 5. So 4 and 5 are not connected. So that's not a clique. How about 3,4,6,7? 3 is connected to 4,6,7. 4 is connected to 3,6,7. 6 is connected to 3,4,7. 7 is connected to all. So that's a clique of size 4: 3,4,6,7. So that's a K4. Similarly, check other groups. For example, 0,1,5,7: 0 is connected to 1,5,7. 1 is connected to 0,5,7. 5 is connected to 0,1,7. 7 is connected to all. So that's another K4. Similarly, 0,2,7, maybe? 0 connected to 2 and 7, but 2 is connected to 7. But 0 and 2 are connected. But that's only three nodes. Not a K4. So the maximum clique size here seems to be 4. So since the maximum clique size is 4, the graph is 4-colorable, as the minimum number of colors needed is equal to the size of the largest clique. Therefore, it should be possible to color this graph with four colors.

Vertex 2: connected to 4 (B),5 (C),7. So vertex 2 can't be B or C. So possible color A. But vertex 1 is A, and vertex 2 is connected to vertex 1? Wait, vertex 2 is connected to 0 (but in the subgraph 1-7, vertex 2 isn't connected to 1. Wait, in the original graph, vertex 2 is connected to 0, but in the subgraph induced by 1-7, the edges are only those between these. So 2 is connected to 4,5,7. So in the subgraph, vertex 2 is connected to 4,5,7. So if we color vertex 2 with color A (since it's not connected to vertex 1), then it's okay. So vertex 2 is A. Then, vertex 7 is connected to 2 (A),5 (C). So vertex 7 can't be A or C. So color B. But vertex 7 is connected to 3, which we haven't colored yet. Let's move to vertex 3. Vertex 3 is connected to 4 (B),5 (C),6,7. So vertex 3 can't be B or C. So color A. But vertex 3 is connected to 6. Let's see. Vertex 6 is connected to 1 (A),3 (A),7 (B). So vertex 6 can't be A or B. So color C. But vertex 6 is connected to 5 (C), which is a problem. So vertex 6 can't be C. Therefore, this coloring doesn't work.

Wait, but the original graph's edges include edges among these vertices. For example, vertex 0 is connected to 1,4,5. Vertex 1 is connected to 4 and 7. Vertex 3 is connected to 4,5,6,7. Etc. So we need to check if the subgraph excluding vertex 2 is 3-colorable. If that is possible, then the entire graph is 4-colorable. But if that subgraph is not 3-colorable, then the entire graph might not be 4-colorable. However, 4 colors should be enough because of the four-color theorem for planar graphs, but I'm not sure if this graph is planar. Wait, but the four-color theorem applies to planar graphs, but maybe this graph isn't planar. Let me think. However, maybe the graph is non-planar. For example, if it contains a K5 or K3,3 subgraph. But vertex 2 is connected to all others, so if we take vertex 2 and any four others, that would form a K5, right? Because vertex 2 is connected to all. Wait, K5 requires 5 mutually connected vertices. So if vertex 2 is connected to 0,1,3,4, etc. But do those vertices form a complete graph among themselves? For example, let's take vertex 2, 0,1,3,4. Vertex 2 is connected to all four, but do 0,1,3,4 form a complete graph? Let's check. 0 is connected to 1 (yes), 0 and 3: original edges don't have (0,3). So no, 0 and 3 are not connected. So the subset 0,1,3,4,2 isn't a complete graph because not all pairs are connected. So maybe it's not a K5. Similarly, check for K3,3. Hmm. Maybe the graph isn't planar, but regardless, the four-color theorem might not apply here. So we can't rely on that. Let's proceed step by step.

Wait, but maybe the coloring of the clique (0,1,2,3) can be adjusted such that vertex 4's color is the same as one of the colors not conflicting with its neighbors. Wait, vertex 4 is connected to 0,1,2. So it can't be the same as 0,1,2. So if 0,1,2 are red, green, blue, then vertex 4 must be yellow. Then vertex 5 is connected to 1,2,3,4. So 1 is green, 2 is blue, 3 is yellow (assuming 0: red, 1: green, 2: blue, 3: yellow). Wait, but then vertex 3 is yellow, so vertex 5 cannot be yellow. Also, vertex 4 is yellow. So vertex 5 is connected to 1 (green), 2 (blue), 3 (yellow), 4 (yellow). So vertex 5 can't be green, blue, or yellow. But we only have red, green, blue, yellow. Then the only possible color is red. But vertex 5 is connected to vertex 0 (red). Oh wait, vertex 5 is connected to 0? Wait, no. Let me check. Vertex 5's neighbors are 1,2,3,4,6,7. So 5 is connected to 1,2,3,4,6,7. It's not connected to 0. So if 0 is red, then vertex 5 is not adjacent to 0. So maybe vertex 5 can be red. So if 0 is red, vertex 5 can be red as long as it's not adjacent to 0. But vertex 5 is connected to 1,2,3,4,6,7. So if 1 is green, 2 is blue, 3 is yellow, 4 is yellow, then vertex 5 can be red. Then check its other neighbors: 6 and 7. If vertex 6 is connected to 5, which is red, so vertex 6 can't be red. Similarly, vertex 7 is connected to 5, so can't be red. But let's try this.

Wait, but node 2 is connected to node 3. Let's check node 3. Node 3 is connected to 0 (Red), 1 (Green), 2 (Green), 4,5,6. So node 3's neighbors are 0 (Red), 1 (Green), 2 (Green). So node 3 cannot be Red or Green. Let's assign Blue or Yellow. But node 7 is Blue, but node 3 is connected to node 7? Let's check. The edges for node 3: (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (3,4), (3,5). So node 3 is not connected to 7. So Blue is possible. Let's assign Blue to node 3. Now, node 3 is Blue. Then, its neighbors (0,1,2,4,5) can't be Blue.

Looking at the edges, let's check vertex 0's neighbors: 0 is connected to 1,2,3,4,6,7. Are any of these all connected to each other? For example, 1 is connected to 3,4,5,6,7. But 1 is connected to 0,3,4,5,6,7. So in the neighbors of 0, 1 is connected to 3,4,6,7 (but not to 2). Similarly, vertex 1's neighbors: 0,3,4,5,6,7. Let's see if any subset forms a clique. For example, 0,1,3,4,7: 0 connected to all, 1 connected to 3,4,7, 3 connected to 0,1,4, 4 connected to 0,1,3,7, 7 connected to 0,1,3,4. So 0-1-3-4-7: 0 is connected to all, 1 is connected to 3,4,7, but 3 is not connected to 7? Wait, 3 is connected to 7 via 3-7? Wait, looking back at the edge list: 3 is connected to 0,1,2,4,5. So 3 is not connected to 7. Therefore, the clique 0,1,3,4,7 isn't a clique because 3 and 7 are not connected. So maybe the maximum clique size is 4. Let's check.

Hmm. Maybe changing the color of vertex 4? Let's try a different color for vertex 4. If instead of Blue, can we assign another color? Wait, vertex 4 is connected to 0 (Red),1 (Green),3 (Yellow). So available colors: Blue. So no choice. So maybe changing vertex 3's color? Let's see. Vertex 3 was assigned Yellow because it was connected to 0 (Red),1 (Green),2 (Blue). So those three colors are taken. If we can assign a different color, but since we only have four, it's Yellow. Hmm. Maybe changing vertex 2's color. Let's see. Vertex 2 is connected to 0 (Red),3 (Yellow),6 (Yellow?), no, original assignment: 2 is Blue, 6 is Yellow. Wait, vertex 2 is connected to 0 (Red),3 (Yellow),6 (Yellow),7. Wait, but vertex 6 is connected to 0,1,2,7. When we colored vertex 6, its neighbors are 0 (Red),1 (Green),2 (Blue),7. So 6 is assigned Yellow. So vertex 2's neighbors are 0 (Red),3 (Yellow),6 (Yellow),7. Therefore, vertex 2's color is Blue. Let me see if there's another color possible for vertex 2. If instead of Blue, maybe Green? But vertex 2 is connected to 1 (Green). So can't be Green. So Blue is the only option. So vertex 2 must be Blue.

Let me check if each in the first set is connected to each in the second. 0 connected to 3 (yes), 0 connected to 5 (no, 0 isn't connected to 5). So that doesn't work. Maybe another combination.

So 3 would connect to 0,1,5. But 4 is connected to 0,1,5. Wait, but in K3,3, each node on one side must connect to all nodes on the other. Let's see. Suppose left side is 2,3,4, and right side is 0,1,5. Check if each of 2,3,4 connects to all of 0,1,5. 2 is connected to 0,1,5? Wait, 2 is connected to 0,1 (edges (0,2) and (1,2)), but 2 is connected to 5 (edge (2,5)), yes. So 2 connects to 0,1,5. 3 is connected to 0,1 (edges (0,3), (1,3)), and 5 (edge (3,5)). So yes. 4 is connected to 0,1 (edges (0,4), (1,4)), and 5 (edge (4,5)). So yes. So this is a K3,3 subgraph. Therefore, the graph contains a K3,3, which makes it non-planar.

Looking at the edges, let's see if there's a K5. Let's check vertices 0,1,2,3,5. Let's see if they form a complete graph. 0 is connected to 1,2,3,5. 1 is connected to 0,2,3,5. 2 is connected to 0,1,5. Wait, 2 isn't connected to 3. So between 2 and 3, there's no edge. So no K5 here. How about another group? Let's check vertices 1,2,5,6,7. 1 connected to 2,5,6,7. 2 connected to 1,5,6,7. 5 connected to 1,2,6. 6 connected to 1,2,5,7. 7 connected to 1,2,5,6. Wait, 5 is connected to 7? Let me check. The edges given for 5 are (0,5), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (5,6). So 5 is connected to 7? Wait, looking back at the edge list, (5,7) isn't listed. The edges for 7 are (0,7), (1,7), (2,7), (3,7), (4,7). So 5 is not connected to 7. So in the group 1,2,5,6,7, 5 isn't connected to 7, so not a K5. How about K3,3? Let's see. K3,3 is a bipartite graph with partitions of 3 nodes each, all edges between partitions. Let's look for such a subgraph.

0 is connected to 1,2,5. Not connected to 3. So 0 doesn't connect to 3, so that's not a K5. What about 1,2,3,5,6? Let's see: 1 is connected to 2,3,5,6. 2 is connected to 1,3,5. 3 is connected to 1,2,5,6. 5 is connected to all. 6 is connected to 1,3,5. But 2 and 6 are not connected, and 3 and 6 are connected. Wait, does 1 connect to 6? Yes. But 2 and 6? No. So that's not a K5. Similarly, checking other groups. Maybe K3,3? Let's see. K3,3 is a bipartite graph with two sets of three vertices each, all edges between the sets. Let me see if such a subgraph exists. For example, maybe vertices 0,1,2 and 5,7, something. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe 1,2,3 connected to 5,6,7. Let's check. 1 is connected to 5,6,7? 1 is connected to 5 and 6, but not 7. Hmm, so maybe not. It's getting complicated. Maybe it's easier to try to apply the planarity condition with Euler's formula. For a connected planar graph, it must satisfy E ≤ 3V - 6. Here, V=8, so 3*8 -6=18. But the graph has 20 edges, which exceeds 18. Therefore, the graph is not planar. So the four-color theorem doesn't apply here. So it's possible that the graph might require more than four colors. Wait, but the four-color theorem is for planar graphs. If the graph is non-planar, it could still be 4-colorable, but it's not guaranteed. So maybe this graph can be colored with four colors, maybe not. So the fact that it's non-planar doesn't necessarily mean it can't be 4-colored. For example, K5 is non-planar and requires 5 colors. So if this graph contains a K5 subgraph, then it would need at least 5 colors. But since we're allowed four, it would be impossible. So let me check if there's a K5 subgraph here.

Now, moving to vertex 3, which is adjacent to 1 (C) and 2 (D). So 3 can't be C or D. But we only have three colors: B, C, D. Wait, but vertex 3 is in the subgraph that needs to be colored with B, C, D. Wait, but if we have three colors, then 3 must be colored with B. So 3 is B. Then vertex 3's neighbors: 1 (C), 2 (D), 4, and 6. So 4 and 6 can't be B. Now, vertex 4 is adjacent to 1 (C), 3 (B), and 7 (C). So 4 can't be C or B. So 4 must be D. Then vertex 6 is adjacent to 1 (C), 3 (B), and 7 (C). So 6 can't be C or B, so must be D. But vertex 6 is adjacent to vertex 7 (C) and vertex 4 (D). Wait, vertex 4 is D, vertex 6 is D. But 4 and 6 are adjacent via edge (4,7) and (6,7). Wait, no, 4 and 6 are not directly connected. Wait, in the subgraph edges, is there an edge between 4 and 6? Let me check. The edges are (1,4), (1,6), (3,4), (3,6), (4,7), (6,7). So no edge between 4 and 6. So if 4 is D and 6 is D, that's okay because they are not adjacent. So that works.

Looking at the edges, let's see if there's a K5. Let's check if any five vertices are all connected to each other. For example, vertex 0 is connected to 1,2,3,4,6. Let's see if 1,2,3,4,6 form a complete graph. 1 connected to 2? No, edge (1,2) isn't listed. So that's not a K5. How about vertex 4, which connects to 0,1,2,5,6,7. Are any five of those forming a complete graph? 0,1,2,5,6: 0 is connected to 1,2,5 (no, 0 isn't connected to 5). So probably no K5. What about K3,3? Let me see. A bipartition of 3 and 3 vertices with all edges between them. Not sure. Maybe vertex 4 is connected to many, but maybe not a complete bipartite. Alternatively, maybe the graph is planar. Since we have 8 vertices and the number of edges is... Let's count edges. Each edge is listed once. Let's count:

But wait, vertex 4 is connected to vertex 3 (yellow). So 4 can't be yellow. Oh, conflict here. So that's a problem. So assigning yellow to 3 and 4 would make them adjacent (since 3 and 4 are connected via edge (1,3) and (1,4), but actually 3 and 4 are not directly connected. Wait, wait: checking the edges again. The edges for 3: (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (3,7). So vertex 3 is connected to 0,1,2,7. Vertex 4 is connected to 0,1,2,5,6,7. Are 3 and 4 connected? Looking at the edge list, (3,4) isn't listed.

Looking at the edges, let's check if there's a complete subgraph with five vertices. Let's see. For example, vertices 0,1,2,3,4. Is this a K5? Let's check. Vertex 0 is connected to 1,2,4 but not to 3. So 0-3 is not an edge. So that's not a K5. How about vertices 1,2,3,4,7? Let's check. 1 is connected to 2,3,4,7. 2 is connected to 1,3,4,7. 3 is connected to 1,2,4,7. 4 is connected to 1,2,3. 7 is connected to 1,2,3,4. Wait, 4 is connected to 1,2,3 but not to 7. So 4-7 is an edge? Wait, looking back: edges include (3,4), (3,7), (0,4), etc. Wait, (4,7): looking at the edge list, does 4 connect to 7? Let me check the edges again. The edges listed for 4 are (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4). Wait, no (4,7). So vertex 4 is not connected to 7. Therefore, in the subset 1,2,3,4,7, vertex 4 is missing an edge to 7, so that's not a K5. How about another set? Let's see vertex 2. Vertex 2 is connected to 0,1,3,4,5,6,7. So maybe a subset around vertex 2. Let's take 2,0,1,3,5. Check if they form a K5. 2 is connected to all. 0 is connected to 1,2,4,5,7. So 0 is not connected to 3, so 0-3 is not an edge. So that subset isn't K5. How about 2,1,3,5,7? 2 connected to all? 2-1, 2-3, 2-5, 2-7. 1 is connected to 3,5? Wait, 1-3 is an edge, 1-5 isn't. Wait, 1 is connected to 0,2,3,4,6,7. So 1 is not connected to 5. So 1-5 is not an edge. Therefore, in the subset 2,1,3,5,7, 1 and 5 are not connected. So that's not a K5.

Alternatively, let's look for a clique. A clique of size 4 would require four colors. Let's see if there's a clique of size 5. If there is a K5 subgraph, then it would require five colors, making it impossible. Let's check. Let's see. Vertex 7 is connected to 0,1,2,3,4,5,6. So 7's neighbors include all others except itself. Let's check if there's a K5 among them. For example, take vertices 0,1,2,3,4. Are they all connected? 0 is connected to 2,4. But 0 is not connected to 1 or 3. So no. How about 2,3,4,5,6. 2 is connected to 3,4,6. 3 is connected to 4,5,6. 4 is connected to 5,6. 5 is connected to 6 via 7? Wait, 5 is connected to 4 and 7, but 5 and 6: looking at the edge list, (5,7) and (6,7) are edges, but is there a direct edge between 5 and 6? The edge list doesn't include (5,6). So no. So maybe no K5. Similarly, check another group. How about 2,3,6,7: they form a K4? 2-3, 2-6, 2-7, 3-6, 3-7, 6-7: yes. So there's a clique of size 4 (vertices 2,3,6,7). So each of these four must have different colors. So 2,3,6,7 must all be different colors. So that's four colors right there. So maybe that's the key. So in that case, assigning each of them a unique color. Then, the remaining vertices (0,1,4,5) need to be colored with the four colors, but not conflicting with their neighbors.

Therefore, the subgraph 5,6,7,3,4 is missing an edge between 3 and 6. So not a K5. Similarly, check other combinations. Maybe 0,1,5,6,7? 0 is connected to 1,5,6,7. But 1 is connected to 5,6,7. 5 is connected to all. But 0 and 5: are they connected? Let's check. The edges for 0: (0,1), (0,3), (0,4), (0,6), (0,7). So 0 is not connected to 5. So that's a missing edge. So not a K5.

Looking at the edges, let's see. Let's check if there's a K5 subgraph. Let's see. For example, vertices 0,1,3,5,6: 0 is connected to 1,3,5,6. 1 is connected to 0,3,5. 3 is connected to 0,1,5,6. 5 is connected to 0,1,3,6. 6 is connected to 0,3,5. Wait, so in this subset, is every pair connected? Let's check. 0-1, 0-3, 0-5, 0-6. 1-3, 1-5. 3-5, 3-6. 5-6. Missing edges: 1-6? 1 is connected to 6? Let me check the original edges. The edges for 1 are (0,1), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5). So 1 is not connected to 6. So the subset 0,1,3,5,6 doesn't form a K5. Similarly, check another subset. How about 3,4,6,7,0? 3 is connected to 0,4,6,7. 4 is connected to 3,6,7. 6 is connected to 3,4,7,0. 7 is connected to 3,4,6,0. 0 is connected to 3,6,7. But edges between 0 and 4? 0 is not connected to 4. So there's no edge between 0 and 4. So that subset isn't a complete graph either. Maybe checking other subsets. What about 3,6,7,4,5? 3 is connected to 6,7,4,5 (3 is connected to 4,5 via edges (3,4), (3,6), (3,7), but 3 is not connected to 5. Wait, 3's edges: (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (3,4), (3,6), (3,7). So 3 is connected to 0,1,2,4,6,7. So 3 is not connected to 5. So in 3,6,7,4,5: 3 is connected to 6,7,4 but not 5. So edges missing between 3 and 5, and 5 and 4? 4 and 5 are connected. 5 and 6 are connected. 5 and 7 are connected. So maybe 4,5,6,7 form a complete graph? Let's check. 4 connected to 5 (yes), 6 (yes), 7 (yes). 5 connected to 6 (yes), 7 (yes). 6 connected to 7 (yes). So 4,5,6,7 form a K4. But not a K5. So maybe the graph doesn't contain a K5. So since it's non-planar but doesn't contain a K5, perhaps it's possible to color with four colors. But the presence of K4 might complicate things. Let's see.

Let's assign Blue to vertex 3. Wait, but then vertex 3 is Blue. Then neighbors of 3 (0,1,2,4,5,6,7) can't be Blue. But vertex 0 is Red, 1 is Green. So for vertex 2, which is adjacent to 0 and 3.

Wait the edges for vertex 1 are (0,1), (1,3), (1,4), (1,6), (1,7). Vertex 2 is connected to 0,3,4,6,7. So vertex 2 is not directly connected to vertex 1.

Vertex 5 is Green. Then vertex 6. Connected to 0 (Red), 1 (Green), 2 (Green), 3 (Blue), 4 (Red), 5 (Green). So adjacent colors are Red, Green, Blue. So vertex 6 can't be Red, Green, or Blue.

Next, let's look at vertex 3, which also has degree 6. It's connected to 0,2,4,5,6,7. Since 0 is Red, 3 can't be Red. Let's assign Green to 3. Now, vertices connected to 3 (0,2,4,5,6,7) can't be Green. So for vertex 2, which is connected to 0 (Red), 1,3 (Green),5,7. So 2 can't be Red or Green. Let's pick Blue for 2. Then vertex 1 is connected to 0 (Red), 2 (Blue),5,7. So 1 can't be Red or Blue. Let's assign Green to 1. Wait, but vertex 1 is connected to 3, which is Green. Oh no! Wait, vertex 1 is connected to 3? Let me check the edges again. The edges for vertex 1 are (0,1), (1,2), (1,5), (1,7). So vertex 1 is not directly connected to 3. So 1 can be Green. Wait, no, vertex 3 is connected to vertex 0,2,4,5,6,7. So 1 is not connected to 3. So assigning Green to 1 is okay. Because 1's neighbors are 0 (Red), 2 (Blue),5,7. So Green is okay for 1.

Wait, in the subgraph (vertices 1-7), vertex 3 is connected to 7? Let me check the original edges. The original edges for vertex 3 are (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (3,4), (3,6). So in the subgraph (vertices 1-7), vertex 3 is connected to 1,2,4,6. So vertex 3 is not connected to 7. Therefore, in the subgraph, vertex 7 is connected to 1,2,4,6.

Looking for a clique of size 5. Let's check nodes 1,2,4,5,6.

Wait, no: checking edges, 5 is connected to 1,2,3,4,7. So 5 is not connected to 6. So in the group 1,2,4,5,6, the connections are: 1-2,1-4,1-5,1-6; 2-4,2-5,2-6; 4-5,4-6; 5-6 is not present.

So maybe the graph is planar. Alternatively, maybe not. But even if it's not planar, since four-color theorem applies to planar graphs, but if it's non-planar, maybe it's still 4-colorable.

Wait, no. Wait in the original edges, vertex 1 is connected to 6, but in the subgraph without 6, vertex 1 is connected to 0,3,4,5. Wait, no. Let me check again. Wait in the original edges, vertex 1 is connected to 0,3,4,5,6. So in the subgraph without 6, vertex 1 is connected to 0,3,4,5. So vertex 1 is not directly connected to 7 in the subgraph. Therefore, vertex 7 is connected to 0,3,4,5. So in the subgraph, vertex 7 is connected to 0 (B), 3 (A), 4 (D),5 (B). So if we color vertex 7 as C, that's okay. Because vertex 1 is C, but they are not connected. So 7 can be C. So let's check:

Vertex 4 is connected to 0 (Green),1 (Blue). So 4 can be Red or Green. But 4 is connected to 0 which is Green, so 4 can't be Green. So 4 must be Red. But vertex 3 is Red, and vertex 4 is connected to 3? Wait, vertex 4 is connected to 3 in the original graph. Wait, in the subgraph (excluding 6), vertex 4 is connected to 0,1,5,7. Wait, no. Let me check the edges again. The edges in the subgraph (excluding 6) for vertex 4: connected to 0,1,5,7. So in the subgraph, vertex 4 is not connected to 3. Wait, original edges: vertex 4 is connected to 0,1,5,6,7. But in the subgraph without 6, vertex 4 is connected to 0,1,5,7. So vertex 4 is not connected to 3 in the subgraph. Therefore, assigning Red to vertex 4 is okay because vertex 3 is Red, but they are not connected in the subgraph. Wait, but vertex 4 is connected to 0 (Green),1 (Blue),5,7. So vertex 4 can be Red. Assign Red to 4. Then neighbors of 4 (0,1,5,7) can't be Red.

Let's try a different color for vertex 3. Instead of Yellow, maybe a different color. But vertex 3 was connected to 1 (Green) and 2 (Blue). So it can't be Green or Blue. So possible colors are Red or Yellow. We tried Yellow. If we try Red, but 3 is connected to 0 (Red), which is not directly connected to 3? Wait, 0 is connected to 1,4,5,6,7, but not to 3. Wait, vertex 3 is connected to 1,2,4,5,6,7. So 3 is not connected to 0. So 3 can be Red. Let me check that again. Vertex 0 is not connected to 3. So 0 is Red, and 3 is connected to 1 (Green), 2 (Blue), 4,5,6,7. So 3 can be Red, because it's not adjacent to 0. Let's try that.

Alternatively, maybe check if the graph contains a complete graph of size 5 (K5), which would require 5 colors. Let's see. The maximum clique size. Let's look for cliques. A clique is a set of vertices where every two distinct vertices are adjacent. So for example, vertex 4 is connected to 0,1,2,5,6,7. Let's check if any subset of these forms a clique. Let's check 4,5,6,7. Are they all connected? 4-5: yes. 4-6: yes. 4-7: yes. 5-6: 5 is connected to 6 via 3? Wait, 5 and 6: looking at edges, (5,6) is not listed. Wait, edges for 5: (0,5), (1,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,7). So 5 is connected to 0,1,3,4,7. So 5 is not connected to 6. Similarly, 6 is connected to 0,1,2,3,4,7. So 5 and 6 are not connected. So 4,5,6,7: 4 connected to all, but 5 and 6 aren't connected. So that's not a clique. How about 3,5,6,7? 3 is connected to 5,6,7. 5 and 6: not connected. 5 and 7: yes. 6 and7: yes. So that's not a clique either. What about 4,6,7: they are all connected. 4-6, 4-7,6-7. So that's a clique of size 3. Similarly, 3,5,7: 3-5,3-7,5-7. That's another clique of size 3. So maybe the maximum clique size is 3 or 4. Let me check if there's a clique of size 4. Let's see, vertices 0,3,4,5: 0 is connected to 3,4,5. 3 is connected to 4 and 5. 4 is connected to 5. So 0-3-4-5: 0 is connected to 3,4,5. 3 is connected to 4 and 5. 4 is connected to 5. But 3 and 4 are connected? Wait, edge (3,4) is not in the list. Let's check the edges. The edges for 3 are (0,3), (1,3), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7). So 3 is connected to 0,1,5,6,7. Not to 4. So 3 and 4 are not connected. Therefore, the 0,3,4,5 isn't a clique. How about 4,5,6,7? As before, 5 and 6 aren't connected. So maybe the maximum clique size is 3. If that's the case, then the graph is 3-colorable? Wait, but the presence of a triangle (clique of 3) only requires 3 colors, but if the graph isn't a tree, maybe needs more. But the four-color theorem says any planar graph is 4-colorable. But is this graph planar? Let me check.

No, 2 isn't connected to 6. So not a complete graph. How about 5,6,7,0,4. 0 is connected to 5? No, 0 is connected to 5 via edges? Wait, 0's edges are 0-1, 0-2, 0-4, 0-6, 0-7. So 0 isn't connected to 5. So that group isn't complete. So maybe there's no K5. So maybe the chromatic number is 4. Let's try to color it.

Alternatively, maybe the graph is 4-colorable. Let's try to assign colors step by step. Let's start with vertex 0. Assign Red. Then its neighbors (1,2,3,4,6) can't be Red. Let's pick vertex 1 next. Assign Green. Now, vertex 1's neighbors (0,2,3,4,5) can't be Green. So vertex 2 is adjacent to 0 (Red) and 1 (Green). So possible colors: Blue or Yellow. Let's assign Blue to vertex 2. Then vertex 3 is adjacent to 0 (Red), 1 (Green), and 2 (Blue). So possible color: Yellow. Assign Yellow to 3. Then vertex 4 is adjacent to 0 (Red), 1 (Green), 2 (Blue). So possible color: Yellow. Assign Yellow to 4. But wait, vertex 4 is connected to 3 (Yellow), so that's a conflict. Oh no, can't do that. So vertex 4 can't be Yellow. Hmm. So maybe need to choose a different color for 4. Let's backtrack. After assigning Red to 0, Green to 1, Blue to 2, Yellow to 3. Then vertex 4's neighbors: 0 (Red), 1 (Green), 2 (Blue). So available color: Yellow. But vertex 3 is Yellow and connected to 4. Wait, 3 is connected to 4? Let me check the edges. The edge list includes (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (4,5), (4,6). Wait, in the original edges, there's no edge between 3 and 4. Wait, vertex 3 is connected to 0,1,2,5,6,7. So 3 is not connected to 4. So vertex 4 is not adjacent to 3. Therefore, if I assign Yellow to 4, that's okay because 3 is Yellow but they're not adjacent. Wait, but 4 is connected to 0,1,2,5,6. So 4 is adjacent to 0 (Red),1 (Green),2 (Blue),5,6. So 4 can be Yellow because none of its neighbors are Yellow. Wait, but does 4 connect to 3? Let me check again. Original edges: (3,7), (3,5), (3,6), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2). So 3 is connected to 0,1,2,5,6,7. No edge between 3 and 4. Therefore, vertex 4 is connected to 0,1,2,5,6. So when we color 4 as Yellow, that's okay. Then proceed to vertex 5. Vertex 5 is adjacent to 1 (Green),2 (Blue),3 (Yellow),4 (Yellow),6,7. So 5 can't be Green, Blue, or Yellow. So available color: Red. Assign Red to 5. Then vertex 6 is adjacent to 0 (Red),2 (Blue),3 (Yellow),4 (Yellow),5 (Red). So 6 can't be Red, Blue, or Yellow. So available color: Green. Assign Green to 6. Then vertex 7 is adjacent to 3 (Yellow) and 5 (Red). So 7 can't be Yellow or Red. Available colors: Green or Blue. Let's pick Blue. Assign Blue to 7.

So vertex 7 is only connected to 3 and 5, which are Yellow and Red. So vertex 7 can be Green or Blue. In our current assignment, we set 7 to Green. But vertex 6 is Green, but since 6 and 7 are not connected, that's okay. So all adjacents:

The edges include (2,7), but not (2,5). Wait, the edges for vertex 2: (0,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,7). So, vertex 2 is not connected to vertex 5. So vertex 5 being Blue is okay, because vertex 2 and 5 are not adjacent. Wait, but vertex 5 is connected to vertex 0 (Red), 1 (Green), 3 (Yellow), 4 (Green), and 7. So vertex 5 can be Blue.

Wait, vertex 5 and 6 are connected? Let me check the edges. The edges include (1,6), (0,6), (3,6), (4,6), (6,7). So 5 and 6 are not directly connected. Wait, is there an edge between 5 and 6? Looking back at the edge list: (0,5), (1,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,7). No, there's no edge between 5 and 6. So assigning Blue to 6 is okay. Then, vertex 6 is Blue. Now, vertex 7 is connected to 0 (Red), 2 (Blue),4 (Green),5 (Blue),6 (Blue). So vertex 7's adjacent colors are Red, Blue, Green. So possible color is Yellow. Assign Yellow to 7.

Wait, but vertex 0 is connected to multiple Greens and Blues. But the rule is that adjacent vertices can't have the same color. So as long as none of 0's neighbors are Red, it's okay. So even if two neighbors are both Green, that's allowed as long as they aren't adjacent to each other. But actually, the problem is if two adjacent nodes have the same color. So for example, if vertex 1 and vertex 3 are both Green, but they are not connected (since 1 is connected to 4,6,7 and 0; 3 is connected to 0,2,4,6). Wait, are 1 and 3 connected? Let me check the edge list. The edges for 1 are (0,1), (1,4), (1,6), (1,7). So 1 is not connected to 3. So even though both are Green, that's okay. Similarly, vertex 2 (Blue) and 6 (Blue) are connected? Let's check. Vertex 2 is connected to 0,3,4,5,7. 6 is connected to 0,1,3,4,5,7. So 2 and 6 are not connected. So their colors can be the same.

Looking for K5: A complete graph of 5 nodes would require that every pair of 5 nodes is connected. Let's see. Take vertices 0,1,2,3,5. Let's check their connections. Vertex 0 is connected to 1,2,3,5. But 1 is connected to 0,2,3,4,5,6. So between 0,1,2,3,5: 0 is connected to all except maybe others. Let's see if all pairs are connected. 0-1, 0-2, 0-3, 0-5. 1-2,1-3,1-5. 2-3? Wait, in the edges given, there is (1,2), (1,3), but does 2-3 exist? Wait, the edges given are listed as (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,5), (0,7), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,6), (4,7), (5,6). So between 0,1,2,3,5: 0 is connected to 1,2,3,5. 1 is connected to 0,2,3,5. 2 is connected to 0,1,4,5,6,7. Wait, 2 is connected to 0,1,4,5,6,7. So 2 is not connected to 3. Similarly, 3 is connected to 0,1,5,6,7. So 3 is not connected to 2. So in the subset 0,1,2,3,5: 2 and 3 are not connected, so that subset isn't a complete graph. Similarly, checking other subsets. Maybe K3,3? Let's see. A bipartite graph with partitions of three nodes each. Let's see if there's a K3,3 here. For example, maybe partitions {0,1,2} and {3,4,5}? Not sure. Let's check if each node in the first partition is connected to all in the second. 0 is connected to 3 (yes), 4 (no), 5 (yes). So that doesn't work. Maybe another partition. Alternatively, maybe {1,2,6} and {4,5,7}? Let's see. 1 is connected to 4,5. 2 is connected to 4,5,7. 6 is connected to 4,5,7. Wait, 1 is connected to 4 and 5, but not 7. 2 is connected to 4,5,7. 6 is connected to 4,5,7. So in the partition {1,2,6} and {4,5,7}: 1 is connected to 4,5 (but not 7); 2 is connected to all three; 6 is connected to all three. So not all nodes in the first partition are connected to all in the second. So K3,3 is not present. Similarly, maybe another combination. Since I can't find K5 or K3,3, maybe the graph is planar. If it's planar, then four colors suffice. But maybe it's not. Alternatively, perhaps the graph is 4-colorable regardless of planarity. Let's try to color it step by step.

Hmm, so vertex 0 is connected to 1,2,3,5,7. That's five neighbors. Similarly, vertex 1 is connected to 0,2,3,4,5,6 – six neighbors. Vertex 2 is connected to 0,1,4,5,6,7 – also six. Vertex 3 is connected to 0,1,5,6,7 – five. Vertex 4 is connected to 1,2,6,7 – four. Vertex 5 is connected to 0,1,2,3,6 – five. Vertex 6 is connected to 1,2,3,4,5,7 – six.

Does vertex 3 connect to many others. Let's see if there's a 4-clique. Let's check vertices 3,6,7. They are all connected to each other? 3-6, 3-7, 6-7. So that's a triangle. Then does any of them connect to another vertex forming a 4-clique? Let's see: 3 is connected to 0,1,2,5,6,7. Let's check if 0,1,2,5 form a clique with 3. For example, 3 is connected to 0,1,2,5,6,7. Let's see if 0,1,2,5 are connected among themselves. 0 is connected to 1,3,4,5,7. So 0 and 1 are connected. 0 and 2 are not connected (since edge (0,2) isn't listed). So 0 and 2 are not connected. Similarly, 0 and 5 are connected. So maybe 0,1,3,5? Let's check if 1 and 5 are connected. Wait, looking back at the edges: (1,3), (1,4), (1,6), (1,7). So 1 is not connected to 5. Therefore, the set 0,1,3,5 isn't a clique. Similarly, maybe 3,6,7,5? 3 is connected to 5,6,7. 5 is connected to 6 and 7. 6 is connected to 7. So 3,5,6,7: let's check all connections. 3-5: yes. 3-6: yes. 3-7: yes. 5-6: yes. 5-7: yes. 6-7: yes. So all pairs are connected. That's a 4-clique!

Start with vertex 0. Assign color Red. Then, its neighbors (1,3,4,5,7) can't be Red. Let's pick the next vertex. Maybe vertex 1. It's connected to 0 (Red), so it can be Green. Then vertex 3 is connected to 0 (Red) and 1 (Green). So it needs a different color, say Blue. Then vertex 7 is connected to 0 (Red), 1 (Green), and 3 (Blue). So it needs the fourth color, Yellow. Then vertex 4 is connected to 0 (Red) and 1 (Green). So it can't be Red or Green. Let's try Blue. But wait, vertex 3 is Blue, and vertex 4 is connected to vertex 3? Let me check the edges. (3,4) is not in the edge list. Wait, in the given edges, is there an edge between 3 and 4? Let me check again: The edges are (0,1), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,7), (1,3), (1,4), (1,6), (1,7), (2,3), (2,4), (2,6), (2,7), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,7). So no edge between 3 and 4. So vertex 4 is connected to 0,1,2,5,6. So vertex 4 is not connected to 3, so if I color vertex 4 Blue, that's okay. So vertex 4 can be Blue. Then vertex 5 is connected to 0 (Red), 3 (Blue), 4 (Blue). So it can't be Red or Blue. So maybe Green or Yellow. Let's see. Vertex 5 is connected to 0,3,4,6,7. Wait, vertex 7 is Yellow. So 5 is connected to 7 (Yellow). So 5 can't be Yellow. So vertex 5 can be Green. Then vertex 6: connected to 1 (Green), 2 (unknown yet), 3 (Blue), 4 (Blue), 5 (Green), 7 (Yellow). So 6 can't be Green, Blue, or Yellow. So possible color is Red. But vertex 2 hasn't been colored yet. Let's get back to that. Vertex 2 is connected to 3,4,6,7. Let's color vertex 2. If vertex 2 is connected to 3 (Blue), 4 (Blue), 6 (Red), and 7 (Yellow). So vertex 2 can't be Blue, Red, or Yellow. So it needs to be Green. So vertex 2 is Green. Then vertex 6 is connected to 1 (Green), 2 (Green), so 6 can't be Green. But earlier, I thought 6 would be Red, but if 2 is Green, then 6 is connected to 2 (Green), so 6 can't be Green. So vertex 6's possible colors: not Green, not Blue (from 3 and 4), not Yellow (from 7). Wait, vertex 6 is connected to 7 (Yellow), so can't be Yellow. So it needs to be Red. But vertex 6 is connected to 5 (Green) as well, which is okay. So 6 can be Red. Let's check:

Are they all connected to each other? 0 is connected to all. Check 1-2: yes. 1-4: yes. 1-5: yes. 2-4: is there an edge between 2 and 4? From the edges list, I don't see (2,4). The edges for 2 are (0,2), (1,2), (2,3), (2,7). So 2 is not connected to 4. Therefore, the subset 0,1,2,4,5 isn't a K5. How about 0,1,3,4,5? 0 is connected to all. 1-3: yes. 1-4: yes. 1-5: yes. 3-4: yes. 3-5: yes. 4-5: yes. So in this subset 0,1,3,4,5: 0 is connected to all except maybe each other.

Let me check the edges. The original edges for 0 are (0,1), (0,2), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7). So 0 is not connected to 3.

Now, vertex 5 is connected to 0 (A), 1 (B), and 2 (B). So vertex 5 needs a color different from A and B. But we're using three colors: A, B, C. So vertex 5 can be colored C. Then vertex 5 is C.

Maybe the graph is planar. Alternatively, perhaps it's non-planar, but given that the four-color theorem applies only to planar graphs, if this is non-planar, maybe it's possible that it requires more than four colors. Wait, but actually, non-planar graphs can sometimes still be colored with four colors if they don't have a K5 subgraph. Wait, but K5 would require five colors. So if the graph contains a K5, then it would need five colors, but if it doesn't, maybe four is enough. But since the four-color theorem is for planar graphs, which are a subset of graphs that don't have K5 or K3,3. So if the graph is non-planar but doesn't contain K5, maybe four colors are still sufficient. But this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe instead of worrying about planarity, I should just try to color the graph step by step.

Let's see: vertex 2 is connected to 0,1,3,5,6,7. Let's see if there's a K3,3 involving vertex 2. Suppose one partition is {0,1,3} and the other is {5,6,7}. Check if each in the first is connected to each in the second. 0 connected to 5? No, edges for 0 are 1,2,4,6,7. 0 is connected to 6 and 7. So 0 is connected to 6 and 7 but not 5. 1 connected to 5: yes. 1 connected to 6? No. 1 connected to 7? No. 3 connected to 5: yes. 3 connected to 6: yes. 3 connected to 7? Edge list: 3 is connected to 4, which is not in the second set. So 3 is connected to 5 and 6 but not 7. So this isn't a K3,3. Maybe another combination? Let's see. Maybe {2,5,6} connected to {0,1,7}. 2 is connected to 0,1,7. 5 connected to 0? No. 5 is connected to 1 and 7. 6 connected to 0,1 (no, 6 is connected to 0,2,3,4,5,7). So 6 connected to 0 and 1? Wait, 6 is connected to 0 via (0,6), to 1? No, 1's edges are (1,0), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5). So 1 and 6 are not connected. So maybe that doesn't form K3,3 either. Hmm, perhaps this graph is planar. If so, then four colors should work.

Therefore, in the group 2,4,5,6,7, 4 is not connected to 6. So that's not a complete subgraph. So maybe there's no K5.

Maybe the graph is planar, so four colors are enough. Since the problem allows four colors, perhaps it's possible. Let's proceed under the assumption that it's possible and try to find a coloring.

Looking for cliques. Let's check vertex 2's connections: 0,1,3,4,5,6. Let's see if any 5 of these form a clique. For example, 2 connected to 0,1,3,4,5,6. Let's see, does 0 connect to all of 1,3? Yes. 0 is connected to 1,2,3,7. So in the neighbors of 2, 0 is connected to 1 and 3 but not to 4,5,6. So maybe not. Let's check if there's a K4. For example, vertices 0,1,2,3. 0 is connected to 1,2,3. 1 is connected to 0,2,3 (since 1 is connected to 0,2,5,7. Wait, 1 is connected to 0,2,5,7. So 1 is not connected to 3. So the subgraph 0,1,2,3: 0-1, 0-2, 0-3, 1-2, 2-3. But 1-3 is not an edge. So it's not a complete K4. How about 2,3,5,6,7? Let's see. 2 is connected to 3,5,6. 3 is connected to 5,6,7. 5 is connected to 6,7. 2 is connected to 7? No, 2 is connected to 0,1,3,4,5,6. So 2 is not connected to 7. So 2-7 isn't an edge. So 2,3,5,6,7: 2 connected to 3,5,6. 3 connected to 5,6,7. 5 connected to 6,7. 7 connected to 5,6. So not a complete clique. Maybe 3,5,6,7? 3 is connected to 5,6,7. 5 is connected to 6,7. 6 is connected to 7. So yes, 3,5,6,7 form a K4. Because 3-5,3-6,3-7; 5-6,5-7; 6-7. All edges present. So that's a complete subgraph of 4 nodes. So a K4 requires 4 colors. So if there's a K4, then we need at least 4 colors. Since we can use four colors, maybe it's possible.

Now, vertex 5 is adjacent to 6 (Green). So 5 can't be Green. So 5 has to be Red, but is that allowed? Vertex 5 is connected to 4 (Red). Wait, if 5 is connected to 4 (Red), then assigning Red to 5 would conflict. So that's a problem. So 5 can't be Red. So 5 must be... All other colors are taken: Green (adjacent to 1), Blue (adjacent to 2), Yellow (adjacent to 3). So no color left. So stuck again.

Now, the question is whether this graph is 4-colorable. Since it's undirected, we can use the four-color theorem which states that any planar graph is 4-colorable. But wait, is this graph planar? Wait, planar graphs can't have a subgraph that's a complete graph of five nodes (K5). Let me check if there's a K5 in here. Let's see: For example, vertices 3,7,0,1,2. Let's check their connections. Vertex 3 is connected to all except itself. So 3 is connected to 7,0,1,2. Vertex 7 is connected to 3,0,1,2. Vertex 0 is connected to 3,7,1,2 (wait, 0 is connected to 1,3,4,6,7. So 0 is connected to 3,7,1 but not 2, right? Wait, 0's edges are (0,1), (0,3), (0,4), (0,6), (0,7). So 0 is not connected to 2. So in the group 3,7,0,1,2: 3 is connected to all except 0 (no, wait 3 is connected to 0). Wait, 3 is connected to 0. So 3 is connected to 0,1,2,4,5,6,7. So in the group 3,7,0,1,2: 3 is connected to all; 7 is connected to 0,1,2,3. 0 is connected to 3,7,1. 1 is connected to 0,3,7,2. 2 is connected to 1,3,7. So is there a K5 here? Let's check if every pair in the group is connected.

Looking back at the edge list: the edges include (4,5), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). So 4 is connected to 0,1,2,3,5. Wait, no edge between 4 and 6. So 4-6 is not an edge. So in the group 1,2,4,5,6, the edge between 4 and 6 is missing, so not a K5. Similarly, check other groups. How about 2,3,6,7, maybe? 2 is connected to 3,6,7. 3 is connected to 6 and 7. 6 is connected to 7. But that's a K4 maybe? Well, 2,3,6,7: 2 connected to all, 3 connected to 6 and 7, 6 connected to 7. Not a complete graph. So maybe there's no K5. How about K3,3? A bipartite complete graph with partitions of three and three. Let's see. For example, vertices 0,2,4 and 1,3,5. Let me check if each of the first group is connected to each of the second. 0 connected to 1 (yes), 3 (no), 5 (no). So that's not. Maybe another combination. Let's see. Maybe 0,1,2 and 3,4,5. 0 connected to 3? No. 1 connected to 3? No. 2 connected to 3? Yes. So not all. Hmm. Maybe not K3,3. So perhaps the graph is planar? If that's the case, then by the four-color theorem, it can be colored with four colors. But maybe the graph isn't planar. Wait, but even if it's not planar, maybe it's still 4-colorable. The four-color theorem is specifically for planar graphs, but non-planar graphs can sometimes be colored with fewer colors. For example, K5 requires five colors, but this graph might not have a K5.

Moving to vertex 1: connected to 2,4,5,6. 4 is Red, so 1 can't be Red. Let's assign Green to vertex 1. Then neighbors of 1 (2,4,5,6) can't be Green. But 4 is Red, so 2,5,6 can't be Green. But vertex 7 is Green, which is connected to 5 and 6. So 5 and 6 can't be Green anyway. Let's check vertex 2. It's connected to 0 (Blue), 1 (Green), 4 (Red), 6,7 (Green). So 2 can't be Blue, Green, or Red. So the only color left is Yellow. Assign Yellow to vertex 2. Now, vertex 2 is Yellow. Then its neighbors (0,1,4,6,7) can't be Yellow. But 0 is Blue, 1 is Green, 4 is Red, 7 is Green, so 6 can't be Yellow. Now, vertex 6 is connected to 1 (Green), 2 (Yellow), 4 (Red), 5,7 (Green). So 6 can't be Green, Red, or Yellow. So the only color left is Blue. Assign Blue to vertex 6. But wait, vertex 6 is adjacent to vertex 0 (Blue), which is a problem! Because 0 is Blue and 6 is Blue, but they are connected via edge (0,6)? Wait, hold on, wait. Wait, looking back at the edges: the edges for vertex 0 are (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,7). There is no edge between 0 and 6. So vertex 6 is connected to 1,2,4,5,7. So 0 and 6 are not adjacent. So vertex 6 being Blue is okay, since it's only adjacent to 1 (Green), 2 (Yellow), 4 (Red), 5,7 (Green). So Blue is allowed. So vertex 6 is Blue.

Alternatively, maybe the graph isn't planar. Let's check if it contains a subgraph that's K5 or K3,3. Let's see. For K5, we need 5 vertices all connected to each other. Looking at the edges, vertex 4 is connected to 0,1,2,3,6,7. So vertex 4 has degree 6. Let's check if any 5-clique exists. Let's look at vertices connected to 4: 0,1,2,3,6,7. Let's check among them. For example, vertices 4,0,2,7: 0 is connected to 2,7. 2 is connected to 7. 4 is connected to all. 4,0,2,7 might form a K4, but not a K5. Let's check another group.

(2,4), (2,7) exist. Also, (0,2), (0,3), etc. So 2 is connected to 4 and 7. 3 is connected to 4,5,7. 4 is connected to 2,3,5,7. 5 is connected to 3,7. 7 is connected to 2,3,4,5.

A complete graph on 5 nodes would require 5 colors, but we only have 3 colors available (since vertex 0 is using one). However, the subgraph here is not a complete graph.

Wait, that's impossible. So vertex 5 can't be colored? That suggests that this initial coloring attempt leads to a conflict. So maybe the order in which we color the vertices matters.

What about K3,3? Let's see if there's a bipartition of 3+3 nodes where each node on one side connects to all nodes on the other. Let's check if, say, vertices 2,3,4 and 5,6,7 form a K3,3. But 2 is connected to 5,6,7. 3 is connected to 5,6,7. 4 is connected to 5,7. But 4 isn't connected to 6. So that doesn't form a complete bipartite. Maybe another set. Alternatively, maybe 0,1,2 and 3,4,5. But 0 is connected to 2,5,6,7. 1 is connected to 2,3,4,6. So perhaps not. It's getting complicated. Maybe the graph is planar. Alternatively, maybe not.

The edges given for 2 are (0,2), (1,2), (2,3), (2,6), (2,7). So 2 is not connected to 5. Therefore, in the group 0,1,2,5,7, the connections are missing 2-5. So that's not a complete K5.

So 6 is connected to 1,2,3,4,7. So 7 is Red, and 1 is Blue, 2 is Yellow, 3 is Blue, 4 is Yellow. So 6 can't be Blue, Yellow, or Red. But since we're using Green, Blue, Yellow for 0-6, and 7 is Red. So 6 can be Green. However, 6 is connected to 5, which we colored Green. Wait, 5 is connected to 6? Let me check. Vertex 5's edges are (1,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,7). So no, 5 is not connected to 6. Wait, the original edges for 5: (1,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,7). So 5 is not connected to 6. Therefore, 6 can be Green even if 5 is Green. Because they are not connected. So that's okay.

Wait, let's check again. If there is a K5 subgraph, then it would need 5 colors. Let's check if any 5 vertices form a complete graph. For example, vertices 3,5,6,7, and another. Vertex 3 is connected to 5,6,7, but 5 is connected to 6 and 7. 6 is connected to 7. Let's see: 3 connected to 5,6,7. 5 connected to 6,7. 6 connected to 7. But 3 is not connected to 5,6,7 through every possible edge. For example, 5 and 6 are connected, 5 and7, 6 and7. But to form K5, every pair must be connected. So if we take vertices 3,5,6,7, and say, 2: 3 is connected to 2,5 is connected to 2,6 is connected to 2,7 is connected to 2? 2 is connected to 3 (yes), 5 (yes),6 (yes),7 (no).

For example, 2 and 7 are not directly connected. So maybe not K5. How about another set? Let's check vertices 2,3,4,5,6. 2 is connected to 3,4,5,6. 3 is connected to 2,4,5,6. 4 is connected to 2,3. 5 is connected to 2,3. 6 is connected to 2,3.

Looking at the edges, vertices 0,1,2,3,4 are all interconnected in a certain way. For example, vertex 2 is connected to 0,1,3,4,5,6. But maybe it's not a K5 because not every pair is connected. Let's see, for example, vertices 0,1,2,4,5: 0 is connected to 2,4,5; 1 is connected to 2,4,5; 2 is connected to all of them; 4 is connected to 0,1,2,5 (since 4 is connected to 5 via edge (4,5) → Wait, looking back, the edges for 4 are (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,7). So 4 is connected to 0,1,2,3,7. Similarly, 5 is connected to 0,1,2,3,7. So maybe 0,1,2,3,4,5,7 form a complex subgraph. But perhaps this graph is planar. Alternatively, maybe not. Wait, but the four-color theorem applies regardless of planarity? No, actually, the four-color theorem specifically applies to planar graphs. If the graph isn't planar, then it might need more colors. But since the problem allows using four colors, maybe the graph is 4-colorable even if not planar. Wait, but the user is asking if it's possible with four colors, not necessarily related to planarity. So regardless of planarity, can we 4-color this graph?

Let me attempt to assign colors. Let's start with vertex 0. Assign Red. Then, its neighbors (2,4,5,6,7) can't be Red. Let's pick vertex 2 next. It's connected to 0 (Red), so possible colors: Green, Blue, Yellow. Let's assign Green. Then, vertex 2's neighbors (0,1,3,4,5,6) can't be Green. Now, vertex 1. It's connected to 2 (Green), so can't be Green. Let's assign Red. Wait, but vertex 1 is connected to 0 (Red), so vertex 1 can't be Red. Oops, that's a mistake. So vertex 1 is connected to 0 via edge (0,6), wait no, 0 and 1 are not directly connected. Wait, looking back: The edges for 0 are (0,2), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7). So 0 is not connected to 1. Wait, is that correct? Let me check again. The edges provided: yes, 0 is connected to 2,4,5,6,7. 1 is connected to 2,4,5,6,7. So 0 and 1 are not directly connected. So vertex 1 is connected to 2 (Green), so can't be Green, but can be Red, Blue, or Yellow. Let's pick Red for vertex 1. Then, vertex 1's neighbors (2,4,5,6,7) can't be Red. Let's proceed to vertex 3. It's connected to 2 (Green), so can't be Green. Assign, say, Blue. Then vertex 3's neighbors (2,4,5,6,7) can't be Blue. Now, vertex 4. Connected to 0 (Red), 1 (Red), 2 (Green), 3 (Blue). So available color: Yellow. Assign Yellow to vertex 4. Vertex 5. Connected to 0 (Red), 1 (Red), 2 (Green), 3 (Blue). So available color: Yellow. Assign Yellow. But wait, vertex 5 is connected to 4? Wait, no. Wait, vertex 4 is connected to 0,1,2,3,7. So vertex 5 is connected to 4? Let me check the edges again. The edge list includes (3,4), but not (4,5). So vertex 5 is connected to 0,1,2,3,7. So vertex 5 is not connected to 4. Therefore, assigning Yellow to both 4 and 5 is okay as they are not adjacent. So vertex 5 can be Yellow. Then vertex 6. Connected to 0 (Red),1 (Red),2 (Green),3 (Blue). So available color: Yellow. Assign Yellow. But vertex 6 is connected to 4? Let me check. Edges for 6: (0,6), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6). So no, vertex 6 is not connected to 4. So vertex 6 can be Yellow. Then vertex 7. Connected to 0 (Red),1 (Red),3 (Blue),4 (Yellow),5 (Yellow). So available color: Green or Blue. Wait, 3 is Blue, so 7 can't be Blue. Green is available. Assign Green to 7.

So this actually forms a complete graph K5: 3,4,5,6,7. Because all pairs among these five vertices are connected. Wait, but K5 has 5 nodes where every node is connected to every other.

So yes, each of the five nodes 3,4,5,6,7 is connected to the other four. Therefore, this is a K5 subgraph. But K5 is non-planar. So the graph is non-planar. But the four-color theorem applies to planar graphs. Since this graph is non-planar, the four-color theorem doesn't directly apply. However, even non-planar graphs can sometimes be colored with four colors. But since K5 requires five colors, because each node is connected to every other, you need five different colors. But since our graph contains a K5 subgraph (vertices 3,4,5,6,7), and we're only allowed four colors, that would make it impossible to color. Wait, but wait, let me confirm. If there's a K5 subgraph, then the chromatic number is at least 5. Since we're only allowed four colors, that would make it impossible. Therefore, the answer should be Impossible.

But 5 is not connected to 6. 7 is connected to 2,3,6. So 7 is connected to 2,3,6. So on the left side 1,5,7, right side 2,3,6. The edges would be 1-6, 5-2,5-3,7-2,7-3,7-6. But 5 is not connected to 6, so 5 doesn't connect to 6, so that's missing. So maybe that's not a K3,3.

So vertex 6 is connected to 0,1,3,5. Wait, but in the edge list, (0,6), (1,6), (3,6), (5,6). So that's four edges. So degree 4. Similarly, vertex 7 is connected to 0,1,2,3,4,5.

Wait, looking back at the edges: 0 is connected to 2,3,4,5,6,7. So 0 is not connected to 1. So 1 can be Red. Wait, wait, the edges for 0 are (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7). So 0 is not connected to 1. Therefore, 1 can be colored Red. Let me correct that. So in my previous step, when I considered coloring 1 as Red, it's okay because 1 isn't connected to 0.

Alternatively, check if the graph contains a complete graph of size 4. If there's a K4 subgraph, then we would need four colors. Let me see if any four vertices are all connected to each other. For example, vertices 5,6,7, and 0. 0 is connected to 5,6,7. But 5,6,7 are all connected to each other (since 5-6, 5-7, 6-7 are edges). So 0,5,6,7 form a K4? Let me check. 0 is connected to 5,6,7. But 5 is connected to 6 and 7, 6 is connected to 7. So in the subgraph induced by 0,5,6,7: each pair is connected except 0-5-6-7? Wait, 0 is connected to all three, but 5,6,7 form a triangle. Wait, no, K4 would require all four vertices to be connected to each other. But 0 isn't connected to 1, 2, etc. Wait, no. In the subgraph 0,5,6,7: edges are 0-5, 0-6, 0-7, 5-6, 5-7, 6-7. So that's 6 edges. But in K4, there are 6 edges. Wait, K4 has 4 vertices each connected to the other three, so 4*3/2=6 edges. So yes, the subgraph 0,5,6,7 is a K4. So that's a complete graph on four vertices, which requires four colors. Therefore, each of these four vertices must have different colors. Therefore, in any valid coloring, 0,5,6,7 must all be different colors. So that's a key point.

Looking at vertex 5: connected to 0,1,2,3,4,6. So vertex 5 is connected to six others. Let's see if there's a K5.

So that's five vertices (5,6,7,0,3) where each is connected to each other? Let's check: 5-6: yes. 5-7: yes. 5-0: yes. 5-3: yes. 6-7: yes. 6-0: yes. 6-3: yes. 7-0: yes. 7-3: yes. 0-3: yes.

So this graph is non-planar. But the four-color theorem applies to planar graphs. Since this graph is non-planar, the four-color theorem doesn't necessarily apply here. So maybe it's possible, maybe not. But even non-planar graphs can sometimes be colored with four colors.

Wait, in an undirected graph, no loops, so vertex 7 is connected to 0,1,2,3,4,5,6. So that's 7 edges. So vertex 7 has degree 7. So that's a key point. All other vertices except maybe some have degree 5. Let me check vertex 0: 0 is connected to 1,2,3,6,7. Five edges. Similarly, vertex 1: 0,3,4,5,7. Five. Vertex 2: 0,4,5,6,7. Five. Vertex 3: 0,1,4,5,7. Five. Vertex 4:1,2,3,6,7. Five. Vertex 5:1,2,3,6,7. Five. Vertex 6:0,2,4,5,7. Five. Vertex 7: seven edges. So vertex 7 is connected to all others. Therefore, vertex 7 is adjacent to every other vertex. That's important because in a coloring, vertex 7 must have a different color from all other vertices. So if there are 7 other vertices, each connected to 7, then each of them must be a different color from 7. Since we have four colors, we need to ensure that vertex 7's color is unique among all its neighbors. But since it's connected to all others, each of the other 7 vertices must be colored with one of the remaining three colors (since vertex 7 uses one color). Wait, but we have four colors total. So if vertex 7 is colored with color A, then all other seven vertices must be colored with B, C, D. But seven vertices and three colors—that would require that at least two of them share the same color, but they are adjacent to each other? Wait, maybe some of those other vertices are not connected. Wait, but in this graph, many of the other vertices are connected. For example, vertex 0 is connected to 1,2,3,6,7. So if 0 is connected to 1, then 0 and 1 can't have the same color. Similarly, 0 and 2 can't, etc. So even though vertex 7 is connected to everyone, the other vertices form a subgraph where each is connected to several others. So maybe the problem reduces to coloring the remaining 7-vertex graph (excluding 7) with 3 colors. Wait, but 3-coloring is NP-hard, but maybe here with the given structure, it's possible. Alternatively, since we have four colors, perhaps vertex 7 takes one color, and the rest can be colored with the remaining three. Wait, but if the rest can't be 3-colored, then we need to use the fourth color. But since vertex 7 is connected to all, the other vertices can't use vertex 7's color, but they can use the other three. Wait, but 3-coloring a graph is possible only if the graph is 3-colorable. So maybe the key is to see if the subgraph induced by vertices 0-6 is 3-colorable. Let me check that. But first, maybe I can try to find a 4-coloring step by step. Let's start by assigning a color to vertex 7, then color the others.

Looking at the edges: Let's check if any five vertices form a complete graph. For example, vertices 0,2,3,4,7: 0 is connected to all. 2 is connected to 0,3,4,7. 3 is connected to 0,2,4,7. 4 is connected to 0,2,3. 7 is connected to 0,2,3,4. So not a complete K5, since 4 and 7 are connected via 0 but not directly. Wait, 4 and 7: they are connected through 0, but not directly. Wait, no edge between 4 and 7? Wait, looking back at the edge list, the edges for 4 are (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,5). So 4 is connected to 0,1,2,3,5. So 4 is not connected to 7. Similarly, 7 is connected to 0,1,2,3,6. So 4 and 7 aren't directly connected. So that group isn't a K5. How about vertices 0,2,3,6,7? 0 connected to all. 2 connected to 0,3,6,7. 3 connected to 0,2,7. 6 connected to 0,2,7. 7 connected to 0,2,3,6. So missing some edges, like 3-6, 2-3 is there. Not a complete K5. So maybe the graph is planar? If so, then by four-color theorem, it is 4-colorable. But I'm not sure if it's planar. Alternatively, maybe it's not planar, but the question is just about 4-coloring. But four colors are allowed here, so even if it's non-planar, maybe it's 4-colorable.

Looking at vertex 0: connected to 1,2,4,5,7. Are any three of these connected to each other? For example, 1 is connected to 2,4,5,7. Let's check if 0,1,2,4 form a clique. 0 connected to all. 1 connected to 2 and 4. 2 connected to 4? The edge (2,4) isn't listed. Wait, edges are: (0,4), (1,4), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7). So 2 is not connected to 4. So 0,1,2,4 isn't a clique. How about 0,1,4,5? 0 connected to all. 1 connected to 4 and 5? Let's check edges from 1: (0,1), (1,2), (1,4), (1,6), (1,7). So 1 is connected to 4 but not to 5. So 0,1,4,5 isn't a clique. How about 0,4,5,7? 0 is connected to 4,5,7. 4 is connected to 5 and 7. 5 is connected to 7. So 0,4,5,7: 0 connected to 4,5,7. 4 connected to 5 and 7. 5 connected to 7. But does 4 connect to 7? Yes, edge (4,7) is present. So 0,4,5,7 form a clique of size 4. Therefore, each of these four must have different colors. Therefore, the graph cannot be colored with fewer than four colors. But since we are allowed four colors, maybe it's possible.

How about K3,3? That's a bipartite graph with two sets of three vertices each, all edges between the sets. Let's see. For example, maybe 0,1,2 in one set and 3,4,5 in another. Let's check. 0 is connected to 2,3,4,6. So 0 is connected to 3 and 4, but 3 and 4 are in the other set. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe vertices 3,6,7 and 4,5, something. Wait, 3 is connected to 0,2,4,5,6,7. 6 is connected to 0,1,3,4,5,7. 7 is connected to 1,3,4,5,6. Maybe that's part of a K3,3. Let's see. Suppose one partition is {3,6,7} and the other {0,1,4}. Let's check if each in the first set connects to all in the second. 3 connects to 0,1 (no, 3 is connected to 0, but 3 isn't connected to 1. Wait, 3's connections are 0,2,4,5,6,7. So 3 is not connected to 1. Similarly, 6 is connected to 0,1,3,4,5,7. So 6 connects to 0,1. 7 is connected to 1,3,4,5,6. So 7 connects to 1. So in the partition {3,6,7} and {0,1,4}, each of 3,6,7 is connected to 0,1,4? 3 is connected to 0 and 4, but not 1. So that's not all. So maybe this isn't K3,3 either. Maybe the graph is planar.

Looking at the graph, let's see if there's a K5. Let's check vertex 3. It is connected to 0,2,4,5,6,7. Let's see if any five of its neighbors form a complete subgraph. The neighbors of 3 are 0,2,4,5,6,7. Let's check if any five of these are all connected to each other. For example, 0 is connected to 2,3,4,6. Not connected to 5 or 7. So probably not a K5. How about 2,4,6,7? Let's see, 2 is connected to 4,6 is connected to 4, etc. Hmm. Maybe not. Alternatively, check for K3,3. Let's see. Maybe the bipartition. For example, vertices 3,4,6 connected to 0,1,2, but I need to see if there's a bipartition with three nodes each. Maybe not immediately obvious. Alternatively, maybe the graph is planar. Alternatively, perhaps it's non-planar. Since the maximum degree is 6, but that alone doesn't determine planarity.

Now, check for K3,3. A complete bipartite graph with partitions of 3 and 3. Let's see. For example, partitions (A,B) where each node in A is connected to each node in B. Let's look for such subsets. Let's see, maybe vertices 1,3,7 in one partition and 4,5,6 in another. Let's check if each of 1,3,7 is connected to 4,5,6. 1 is connected to 4,6, but not to 5. So that doesn't work. How about another partition. Let's see, vertex 3 is connected to 0,2,4,5,6,7. Maybe partition A: 3,4,6 and partition B: 0,2,5. Let's check if each in A is connected to each in B. 3 is connected to 0,2,5. 4 is connected to 0,2 (but not to 5). 6 is connected to 0 (but not to 2 or 5). So that doesn't work. Maybe another combination. Alternatively, maybe the partitions are 1,2,5 and 3,6,7. Let's check. 1 is connected to 2, but in a bipartition, nodes within the partition shouldn't be connected. So since 1 and 2 are in the same partition but connected, that's invalid. Maybe another approach. Alternatively, maybe 3,4,6 as one partition and 0,1,7 as another. Check if each in first is connected to each in second. 3 connected to 0,1,7. 4 connected to 0,1,7. 6 connected to 0,1,7. So yes! Wait, if partition A is {3,4,6} and partition B is {0,1,7}, then each node in A is connected to each node in B. Let me confirm:

- 4 is connected to 5 (through edge (4,5)? Wait, looking back at the edges, I don't see an edge between 4 and 5. Wait, the edges given for 4 are (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,6), (4,7). So 4 is connected to 0,1,2,3,6,7. So 4 is not connected to 5. Similarly, vertex 5's edges: (0,5), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (5,6), (5,7). So 5 is not connected to 4. Therefore, vertices 4 and 5 are not adjacent. So a group including both 4 and 5 would not form a K5 since they aren't connected. Similarly, let's check another group. Take vertices 1,4,5,6,7. Vertex 1 is connected to 4,5,6,7. But 4 and 5 aren't connected. So that's not a K5. How about 3,4,6,7,5? 3 is connected to 4,5,6,7. 4 is connected to 6,7 but not 5. 5 is connected to 6,7. 6 is connected to all. So 3,5,6,7,4: 4 and 5 are not connected, so not K5.

Another approach: since the subgraph of neighbors of 6 (excluding 6) is quite interconnected, perhaps it's a 3-colorable graph. But maybe not. Let's check if it's bipartite? If it's bipartite, it's 2-colorable. But given the connections, I don't think so. For example, there's a triangle? Let's see. 4 connected to 5, 5 connected to 7, 7 connected to 4? Wait, 4 and 5 are connected, 5 and 7 are connected, but 4 and 7 are connected. So 4-5-7-4 forms a triangle? Wait, 4-5-7 is a triangle? 4 connected to 5, 5 connected to 7, and 4 connected to 7. Yes, that's a triangle (3-cycle). So a triangle cannot be 2-colored. Therefore, the subgraph is at least 3-colorable. Since it contains a triangle, it requires at least 3 colors. So maybe 3 colors are sufficient.

So in the subset 0,1,2,3,6, vertex 2 isn't connected to 3. Because vertex 2 is connected to 3? Wait, the edges include (1,2), (0,2), (2,4), (2,5), (2,7). Wait, does vertex 2 connect to 3? Wait, looking back at the edge list: the edges for 2 are (0,2), (1,2), (2,4), (2,5), (2,7). Wait, so vertex 2 is not connected to 3. Then in the subset 0,1,2,3,6: 2 is not connected to 3, so that's not a K5. Similarly, check another subset. Maybe 0,1,3,5,6. Let's see: 0 is connected to all. 1 connected to 0,3,5,6? Wait, 1's edges: (0,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,6), (1,7). So 1 is connected to 0,2,3,6,7. So in 0,1,3,5,6: 1 is connected to 0,3,6. 5 is connected to 0,2,3,4,6. Wait, in this subset, 5 is connected to 0,3,6. So 5 is not connected to 1. Therefore, 1 and 5 are not connected. So that subset isn't a K5. Similarly, maybe another group.

0 connected to 1: yes. 0 connected to 2? No. 0 is connected to 1,4,5,6. So 0 is not connected to 2,3. So the subgraph 0,1,2,3,4 is not complete. Similarly, check another set. How about 1,2,3,4,5. Let's see. 1 connected to 2: yes. 1 connected to 3: yes. 1 connected to 4: No. 1 is connected to 0,2,3,5,6,7. So 1 is not connected to 4. Therefore, this isn't a complete subgraph either. So maybe there's no K5 here, which is good. Similarly, check for K4. For example, vertices 1,5,6,7. 1 is connected to 5,6,7. 5 is connected to 6 and 7. 6 is connected to 7. So that's a K4: 1,5,6,7. Each is connected to each other. So that's a complete subgraph of four nodes, which would require four different colors. So that's possible. Since we have four colors, that's manageable.

Wait, looking back at the edges: (0,4) isn't listed. Wait, no. The edges for 0 are (0,1), (0,3), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7). So 0 isn't connected to 4. So 4 is connected to 1,2,3,5,6,7. So 0 is not adjacent to 4. Therefore, if we color 4 as Red, vertex 0 can be Red as well if possible, but 0 is connected to 1,3,5,6,7. Since 6 is Green, 0 can't be Green. Let's try coloring 0 as Red.

Let me check for K5. Let's look at vertex 0: connected to 1,2,3,5,7. Are any five of these mutually connected? Let's check if 0,1,2,3,5 form a K5. 0 is connected to all. 1 is connected to 0,2,3,5. 2 is connected to 0,1,3 (since 0-2, 1-2, but is 2 connected to 3? Wait in the edges list, there's no edge between 2 and 3. The edges for 2 are (0,2), (1,2), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7). So 2 is not connected to 3. Therefore, 0,1,2,3,5 do not form a K5. How about another group? Let's check vertices 1,2,5,6,7. 1 is connected to 2,5,6,7. 2 is connected to 1,5,6,7. 5 is connected to 1,2,6. 6 is connected to 1,2,5,7. 7 is connected to 1,2,6. Wait, but 5 and 7 are connected via edge 4-7, but 5 and 7: looking at edges, 0-7, 1-7, 2-7, 4-7, 6-7. 5 is connected to 7? Let me check edge list again. The edges for 5: (0,5), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,6). So 5 is connected to 0,1,2,3,4,6. So 5 is not connected to 7. Therefore, in the group 1,2,5,6,7: 1 is connected to all except maybe 5 and 7? Wait, 1 is connected to 5 and 7. 2 is connected to 1,5,6,7 (but 2 is not connected to 5? Wait 2 is connected to 5 (yes, edge 2-5 is there). So 1-2-5-6-7: 1 connected to 2,5,6,7; 2 connected to 1,5,6,7; 5 connected to 1,2,6; 6 connected to 1,2,5,7; 7 connected to 1,2,6. So 5 is not connected to 7. Therefore, that group is not a complete graph. Maybe check another group. Alternatively, maybe check for K3,3 as a minor? But this might be time-consuming.

How about K3,3? Let's see. A bipartite graph with partitions of three and three. Let's see if there's a set of three vertices connected to another three with all possible edges. Maybe vertices 0,1,2 connected to 5,6,7. Let's check if each of 0,1,2 is connected to all of 5,6,7. 0 is connected to 5 and 7 but not to 6. So no. 0 is connected to 5,7, but not 6. So that's not all. So maybe another combination. Maybe 1,2,5 connected to 6,7, something else. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe 1,2,3 connected to 5,6,7. Wait, 1 is connected to 5,6,7. 2 is connected to 5,6,7. 3 is connected to 5,6. So if we take partitions as {1,2,3} and {5,6,7}, is every connection present? 1 is connected to all in the second partition. 2 is connected to all in the second partition. 3 is connected to 5 and 6 but not 7. So no, missing 3-7. So that's not a complete bipartite.

Looking at K5: a complete graph of 5 vertices where each vertex is connected to every other. Let's check. For example, vertices 0,2,3,5,6,7 are connected in various ways. Let's see if any five of them form a K5. Let's check 0,2,3,5,6. Vertex 0 is connected to all of them. Vertex 2 is connected to 0,3,5 but not to 6 (since 2 is connected to 0,1,3,4,5). Wait, 2 is connected to 0,1,3,4,5. So 2 is not connected to 6 or 7. So in the subset 0,2,3,5,6: 2 is not connected to 6. So that's not a K5. How about another group? Let's look at vertices 6,7,0,1,3. Vertex 6 is connected to 0,1,3,4,5,7. So in the subset 6,7,0,1,3: 6 is connected to all except perhaps 4 and 5, which are not in the subset. So 6 is connected to 0,1,3,7. Each of these vertices: 0 connected to 7,1,3; 1 connected to 0,3,7; 3 connected to 0,1,6,7; 7 connected to all except 2. Wait, in the subset 0,1,3,6,7: 0 is connected to 1? Wait, no. Wait, the edges between 0 and 1: looking back at the edges, I don't see (0,1) listed. Wait, original edges: (0,2), (0,3), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7). So 0 is not connected to 1. Similarly, 1 is connected to 2,3,5,6,7. So 0 and 1 are not connected. Therefore, in the subset 0,1,3,6,7: 0 is not connected to 1, so that's not a complete graph. Similarly, maybe another subset. Let's check 6,7,3,5,0. 6 is connected to 0,3,5,7. 7 is connected to 0,3,5,6. 3 is connected to 0,5,6,7. 5 is connected to 0,3,6,7. 0 is connected to 3,5,6,7. So in this subset, each vertex is connected to the others except maybe between 0 and 5? Wait, 0 is connected to 5. So 0 is connected to all except 1 and 4.

How about K3,3? Let's see. K3,3 is a bipartite graph with two sets of three vertices each, all edges between sets. Let's look for such a structure. For example, maybe vertices 0,1,2 in one set and 3,5,6 in another? Let's check if each of 0,1,2 is connected to all of 3,5,6. 0 is connected to 3,5,6. 1 is connected to 3,5,6. 2 is connected to 3,5 (since 2 is connected to 3 and 5, but is 2 connected to 6? Let's check vertex 2's edges: 0,1,3,4,5. No, 2 is not connected to 6. So that set doesn't work. How about another combination? Maybe 0,1,5 and 2,3,6. Let's see: 0 connected to 2,3,5,6. 1 connected to 2,3,5,6. 5 connected to 2,3,6. So 0 in set A (0,1,5) connected to set B (2,3,6). 0 is connected to 2,3,6. 1 is connected to 2,3,6. 5 is connected to 2,3,6. But in K3,3, each vertex in set A must connect to all in set B. So 0 connects to 2,3,6? Wait, 0 is connected to 2,3,5,6,7. So yes, 0 is connected to 2,3,6. 1 is connected to 2,3,5,6,7. So 1 is connected to 2,3,6. 5 is connected to 2,3,6. So yes, if set A is 0,1,5 and set B is 2,3,6, then each in A is connected to all in B. But wait, in K3,3, there should be no edges within the sets. Let's check: In set A (0,1,5), are there edges between them? 0 and 1: no. 0 and 5: yes, 0 is connected to 5. 1 and 5: yes, 1 is connected to 5. So in set A, there are edges between 0-5 and 1-5. Therefore, that's not a bipartite graph. So K3,3 requires that the two sets are independent (no edges within each set). So that attempt doesn't work.

So the key here is whether the graph contains a complete graph with 5 nodes (K5) or a complete bipartite graph K3,3. Because those are the non-planar graphs.

Hmm. Let me try to visualize this. Vertex 0 is connected to 1,2,4,6,7. So degree 5. That's a pretty high degree. Then vertex 1 is connected to 0,4,5. Degree 3. Vertex 2 is connected to 0,3,4,5,6. Degree 5. Vertex 3 is connected to 2,4,6,7. Degree 4. Vertex 4 is connected to 0,1,2,3,5,6,7. Wow, degree 7! That's the highest. Vertex 4 is connected to every other vertex except maybe itself. Wait, no, checking edges: 0,1,2,3,5,6,7—yes, vertex 4 is connected to all 7 others. So vertex 4 has edges to every other vertex. That's important. Then vertex 5 is connected to 1,2,4,6,7. Degree 5. Vertex 6 is connected to 0,2,3,4,5,7. Degree 6. Vertex 7 is connected to 0,3,4,5,6. Degree 5.

But vertex 4 is connected to all others. So if we take vertex 4 and any four other vertices, say 0,1,2,3, then since 4 is connected to all of them, but are those other vertices connected among themselves? Let's check. For example, 0 is connected to 1,2, but 0 is not connected to 3. So the subgraph induced by 4,0,1,2,3 would have 4 connected to all, but 0 not connected to 3. So that's not a complete graph. Similarly, maybe another set. Let's check 4,0,2,5,6. 4 is connected to all, but 0 is connected to 2,5,6. 2 is connected to 5 and 6. 5 is connected to 6. So maybe in this subset, there might be a K5. Wait, but K5 requires every pair to be connected. Let's see: 4 is connected to all. 0 is connected to 2,5,6. So 0 is not connected to 5 and 6? Wait, no: Looking back, 0 is connected to 1,2,4,6,7. So 0 is connected to 5? Wait, no. The edges for 0 are (0,1), (0,2), (0,4), (0,6), (0,7). So 0 is not connected to 3 or 5. So in the subset 4,0,2,5,6, vertex 0 is connected to 4,2,6, but not to 5. So that's missing. So that's not a K5. Similarly, maybe another subset. It's possible that the graph isn't planar, but maybe it is. However, the four-color theorem applies to planar graphs. If this graph is non-planar, then the theorem doesn't apply, but we can use more colors if necessary. But since the problem allows four colors, maybe it's possible.

Looking at the edges, let's see if there's a K5 subgraph. Let's check vertex 4. Since it's connected to 0,1,2,3,5,6,7. Let's see if any five of these form a K5. For example, vertex 4,0,1,2,6. Let's check if all these are connected to each other. 0 is connected to 1,2,4,6. So 0-1, 0-2, 0-4, 0-6. Then 1 is connected to 4, and 1-5, but not to 2 or 6 except through other edges. Wait, 1 is connected to 0,4,5. So 1 is not connected to 2 or 6. Therefore, the subset 4,0,1,2,6 would not form a K5 because, for example, 1 is not connected to 2 or 6. How about another subset: vertex 4,2,5,6,7. Let's check. 4 is connected to all. 2 is connected to 4,5,6,3,0. 5 is connected to 4,2,6,7,1. 6 is connected to 4,2,5,7,0,3. 7 is connected to 4,5,6,3,0. So within this subset, 2 is connected to 5 and 6. 5 is connected to 6 and 7. 6 is connected to 7. But are all pairwise connections present? Between 2 and 7: according to edges, 2 is connected to 3,4,5,6,0. Not to 7. Wait, looking back at the edges list, (2,7) is not present. The edges involving 2 are (0,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6). So 2 is not connected to 7. Therefore, in the subset 4,2,5,6,7, the edge between 2 and 7 is missing, so it's not a complete graph.

0 is connected to 1,2,4,6,7. So 0 is connected to 1,2,4 but not necessarily 5. Wait, 0 is connected to 5? Let me check the edges again. The edges for 0 are (0,1), (0,2), (0,4), (0,6), (0,7). So 0 is not connected to 5. Therefore, in the subset 4,0,1,2,5: 0 is not connected to 5, so that's not a complete subgraph. Similarly, check other combinations. Let's check 4,1,2,5,6. 4 is connected to all. 1 is connected to 4,5. 1 is connected to 2? Wait, the edges for 1 are (0,1), (1,4), (1,5). So 1 is not connected to 2,3,6,7 except through other edges. So 1 and 2 are not connected. So in the subset 4,1,2,5,6: 1 is not connected to 2 or 6, so that's not a complete subgraph. How about 4,2,3,5,6? 4 is connected to all. 2 is connected to 3,4,5,6. 3 is connected to 4,6,7. 5 is connected to 4,6,7. 6 is connected to 4,2,3,5,7. Wait, in this subset 4,2,3,5,6: 2 is connected to 3 (yes), 2 to 5 (yes), 2 to 6 (yes). 3 is connected to 5? Let's check the edges: 3's edges are (2,3), (3,4), (3,6), (3,7). So 3 is not connected to 5. Therefore, 3 and 5 are not connected, so that's not a complete subgraph. Similarly, 4,5,6,7: 4 connected to 5,6,7; 5 connected to 6,7; 6 connected to 7. So that's a K4.

First, let me list out all the edges. Vertex 0 is connected to 4,5,6,7. That's four edges, so degree 4. Then vertex 1 is connected to 2,3,5,6,7. That's five edges, degree 5. Vertex 2 is connected to 1,3,4,6. So degree 4. Vertex 3 is connected to 1,2,4,5,6. That's five edges. Vertex 4 is connected to 0,2,3,5,6. So degree 5. Vertex 5 is connected to 0,1,3,4,6,7. Degree 6. Vertex 6 is connected to 0,1,2,3,4,5,7. Wait, let me count: 0,1,2,3,4,5,7—that's seven edges. So vertex 6 has degree 7, connected to all except maybe itself? Wait, no, in an undirected graph, edges are between different vertices, so vertex 6 is connected to 0,1,2,3,4,5,7. Yes, all other seven vertices. Wait, that can't be. Let me check the edges again.

Then vertex 2 is connected to 1 (blue), 3, 4 (yellow), 6 (green). So vertex 2 cannot be blue, yellow, or green. So possible color is red. Assign red to vertex 2. But vertex 2 is connected to vertex 5 (red). Wait, vertex 2 and 5: are they connected? Let me check. Looking at the edges, vertex 2's edges are (1,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,6). So vertex 2 is not connected to 5. So no, vertex 2 is not adjacent to 5. So assigning red to vertex 2 is okay, since vertex 5 is red but they're not adjacent. Wait, but vertex 2 is connected to 1 (blue), 3, 4 (yellow), and 6 (green). So red is available. Assign red to vertex 2.

How about K3,3? Let's see. A bipartition of two sets of three vertices each, with each vertex in one set connected to all in the other. For example, maybe set A: 0,1,2 and set B: 6,7, something else. Let's check. 0 is connected to 6,7. 1 is connected to 6,7. 2 is connected to 6,7. But set B would need to be 6,7, maybe 4? But 4 is connected to 0,1,2? Wait, 4 is connected to 1, but not to 0 or 2. So maybe not. Alternatively, another combination. Maybe set A: 3,4,5 and set B: 1,6,7. Let's see: 3 is connected to 1,4,5,7. 4 is connected to 1,3,5,6,7. 5 is connected to 3,4,6,7. Hmm, but in a K3,3, each vertex in set A must connect to all in set B. So if set A is 3,4,5 and set B is 1,6,7, then 3 must connect to 1,6,7. But 3 is connected to 1 and 7, but not to 6. So that doesn't work. Maybe another combination. Maybe set A:0,2,5 and set B:6,7,4. Let's check. 0 connected to 6,7. 2 connected to 6,7. 5 connected to 6,4. But 0 isn't connected to 4, 2 isn't connected to 4, so not all connections. Not a K3,3. Maybe it's planar then. If it's planar, then four colors should suffice. But wait, maybe I'm missing something here. Alternatively, maybe the graph is non-planar. Let me count the edges. The graph has 19 edges. For a planar graph, the maximum number of edges is 3n - 6, where n is the number of vertices. Here, n=8, so 3*8 -6=18. But we have 19 edges, which is more than 18. Therefore, the graph is non-planar. So the four-color theorem applies to planar graphs, but since this graph is non-planar, we can't rely on that theorem. However, non-planar graphs can still sometimes be colored with four colors. For example, K5 requires five colors, but if our graph is a different non-planar graph, maybe it can still be four-colored.

Looking at the edges, check if any group of five vertices are all connected. Let's see: vertex 6 is connected to 0,1,2,4,5,7. So if we pick vertices 0,1,2,6,7: Let's check if all are connected. 0 is connected to 1,2,6,7. 1 is connected to 0,3,4,6,7. So between 0,1,2,6,7: 0 is connected to all except maybe 2? Wait, 0 is connected to 2. So 0-1, 0-2, 0-6, 0-7. Then 1 is connected to 2? Wait, no, the edge list doesn't have (1,2). Wait, original edges: (0,1), (0,2), but no (1,2). So 1 and 2 are not connected. So the clique can't include both 1 and 2. How about vertices 1,3,4,5,7? Let's check if they form a clique. 1 is connected to 3,4,7. 3 is connected to 1,4,5,7. 4 is connected to 1,3,5,7. 5 is connected to 3,4,7. 7 is connected to 1,3,4,5. Wait, but 1 isn't connected to 5. So in this group, 1 is not connected to 5. So that breaks the clique. Similarly, maybe 0,6,7,2,4? Let's see: 0 is connected to 6,7,2. 6 is connected to 0,2,4,7. 7 is connected to 0,2,4. 4 is connected to 6,7. But 4 isn't connected to 0 or 2 (except via 6 or 7). So maybe not a clique.

Looking at the edges, does any subset of five vertices form a K5? Let's see. For example, vertices 0,1,6,7, and maybe others. Let's check if 0 is connected to 1,6,7. Is 1 connected to 6,7, yes. 6 is connected to 7. But maybe not all possible connections. For K5, every pair must be connected. Let's check some group. Take vertices 1,3,4,5,7. 1 is connected to 3,4,7. 3 is connected to 1,4,5,7. 4 is connected to 1,3,5,7. 5 is connected to 3,4,7. 7 is connected to 1,3,4,5. Wait, but 1 and 5 are not connected. 1 is connected to 3,4,6,7,0. So 1 and 5 aren't directly connected. So that's not a K5. Similarly, maybe another group. How about 0,1,2,6,7. 0 is connected to all except 3,4,5. 1 is connected to 0,3,4,6,7. So 1 isn't connected to 2. So that's not a K5 either. Maybe K3,3? Let's see. For example, split into two sets. Suppose 0,1,2 as one set and 6,7, another. But maybe not. Alternatively, looking for a bipartition where each node in one set connects to all in the other. Not sure. Maybe it's planar.

Vertex 7 is connected to 1 (Blue), 2 (Yellow), 4 (Yellow), and 6 (Blue). So 7 can't be Blue or Yellow. So color it Green.

Vertex 5 is connected to 1,2,3,6. Wait, in the subgraph without 3, vertex 5 is connected to 1,2,6. So vertex 5 is not connected to 7. So 7 can be Green. Because 7 is connected to 5?

Wait, maybe the graph contains a complete graph of five nodes (K5), which is non-planar. Let me check. The complete graph K5 has each vertex connected to every other. Let's see if there's a subset of five vertices here where each is connected to the others. Let's look for a K5 subgraph. For example, vertex 3 is connected to 0,1,2,4,5,6,7. Let's check if any five of those form a complete subgraph. Let's take vertices 0,1,2,3,4. Is this a K5? Let's see: 0 is connected to 1,3,4. But 0 is not connected to 2. So no. How about 1,2,3,5,7? 1 is connected to 2,3,5,7. 2 is connected to 1,3,5,7. 3 is connected to 1,2,5,7. 5 is connected to 1,2,3. 7 is connected to 1,2,3. But 5 and 7: are they connected? In the edge list, 5 is connected to 1,2,3,6. 7 is connected to 1,2,3,4,6. So 5 and 7 are not connected. So that's not a complete subgraph. How about 3,1,2,5,6? 3 is connected to all of them, but 1 is connected to 2,3,5, but not 6. So that's not complete. Maybe 3,2,5,6,7? 3 connected to all. 2 is connected to 5,6,7. 5 connected to 2,6. 6 connected to 2,5,7. 7 connected to 2,5,6. Wait, but 5 and 7 are not connected. So no. So perhaps there's no K5. Then maybe a K3,3? Let's check for a bipartite complete graph K3,3. That's a bipartition of two sets of three vertices each, with each vertex in one set connected to all in the other. Let's see. For example, maybe set A: 0,1,4 and set B: 2,5,7. Checking edges: 0 is connected to 1 (same set), so that's not bipartite. Maybe another partition. Wait, perhaps vertices 1,2,3 and 5,6,7. But 1 is connected to 5 and 7, but 2 is connected to 5,6,7, and 3 is connected to 5,6,7. But in K3,3, each node in set A must connect to all in set B. So if set A is 1,2,3 and set B is 5,6,7, then 1 is connected to 5 and 7, but not 6. So that doesn't work. Maybe another combination. Alternatively, perhaps the graph is planar. If it's planar, then by four-color theorem, it can be colored. But maybe it's non-planar.

Looking at the graph, let's see. Vertex 4 is connected to 1,2,3,5,6,7. So the neighbors of 4 are 1,2,3,5,6,7. Let's check if any of these form a clique. For example, 4 and 1,2,3. Are 1,2,3 all connected? 1 is connected to 2 and 3. 2 is connected to 1 and 3 (since 1-2 and 1-3 are edges, but is 2-3 an edge? Wait, in the edge list, the edges between 2 and 3: original edges for 2 are 0,1,4,5,6. Wait, no, looking back, the edges for 2: (0,2), (1,2), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6). So 2 is connected to 0,1,4,5,6. No edge between 2 and 3. So the neighbors of 4 include 1,2,3,5,6,7. Let's check the connections between these.

Looking at vertices 3,5,6,7. Let's see their connections. For example, 3 is connected to 0,1,2,4,5,6. Let's check 3,5,6,7, and another. Let's see if 3,5,6,7, and 4 form a K5. 3 is connected to 5,6,7,4. 5 is connected to 3,6,7,4, etc. Wait, 4 is connected to 3,5,6,7. So between 3,4,5,6,7: each is connected to the others except maybe between 4 and, say, 2? Wait, 4 is connected to 3,5,6,7. So 4 is not connected to 0,1,2. But in the group 3,4,5,6,7, each is connected to all others except maybe 4 and some others. Wait, 3 is connected to 4. 4 is connected to 5,6,7. 3 is connected to 5,6,7. 5 is connected to 6,7. 6 is connected to 7. So in the subset {3,4,5,6,7}: 3 is connected to 4,5,6,7. 4 is connected to 3,5,6,7. 5 is connected to 3,4,6,7. 6 is connected to 3,4,5,7. 7 is connected to 3,4,5,6. So yes, in this subset of 5 vertices, each vertex is connected to every other. That's a K5. Therefore, the graph contains K5 as a subgraph, making it non-planar. Therefore, the four-color theorem doesn't apply here. But wait, even non-planar graphs can sometimes be colored with four colors, but it's not guaranteed. So the four-color theorem only says planar graphs can be colored with four colors, but non-planar graphs might need more. However, in practice, maybe this particular non-planar graph can still be colored with four.

Alternatively, maybe the graph is 4-colorable. Let's try to find a coloring. Let's start by assigning colors to the highest-degree nodes first, as they have the most constraints. So vertex 1 and 5 have degree 6. Let's start with vertex 1. Let's assign it Red. Then all its neighbors (0,3,4,5,6,7) cannot be Red. Then vertex 5 is another high-degree node. Since vertex 5 is connected to vertex 1 (which is Red), we can't color it Red. Let's choose Green. Then all neighbors of 5 (0,1,2,3,6,7) can't be Green. Next, vertex 0 is connected to 1 (Red) and 4,5 (Green). So vertex 0 can't be Red or Green. Let's assign Blue. Then vertex 0 is Blue. Then vertex 4 is connected to 0 (Blue), 1 (Red), 2,3,6. Let's see, vertex 4's current neighbors: 0 (Blue), 1 (Red). So it can't be Blue or Red. Let's assign Green. But wait, 4 is connected to 5 (Green)? Wait, vertex 5 is Green, and vertex 4 is connected to 5 (edge exists between 4 and 5). So if we color 4 Green, that would conflict with 5. So that's a problem. So vertex 4 can't be Green. So maybe we need another color. It can't be Red (due to 1), Blue (due to 0), or Green (due to 5). So the only remaining color is Yellow. Assign vertex 4 to Yellow. Now vertex 4 is Yellow.

Then node 5 is connected to 0 (Red) and 1 (Green). So node 5 can't be Red or Green. Let's assign Blue as well. Wait, but node 5 is connected to 4 (Blue), so if we assign Blue to node 5, that's a conflict. Because node 4 and 5 are connected (edge 0-5 and 4-5?) Wait, looking back, edge list: (0,5), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (5,6), (5,7). Also, (3,4) is an edge. So node 5 is connected to 4? Wait, in the edges given, there's (3,4) and (3,5), but is there a direct edge between 4 and 5? Let me check. The edges listed include (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,6). So 4 is connected to 0,1,2,3,6. Wait, no edge between 4 and 5. Wait, node 4 is connected to 0,1,2,3,6. Node 5 is connected to 0,1,2,3,6,7. Wait, so node 4 and 5 are not directly connected. So node 5 is connected to 0,1,2,3,6,7. So node 5 is not adjacent to node 4. So assigning Blue to node 5 is okay, since node 4 is Blue but they are not connected. Wait no, node 4 is connected to node 0,1,2,3,6. So 4 and 5 are not connected. So node 5 can be Blue even if 4 is Blue. That's okay. So node 5 is Blue.

Looking for a bipartite complete subgraph K3,3. Let's see. For example, maybe vertex 1 connected to 0,3,4,5,6,7. Maybe there's a bipartition. But maybe not. Alternatively, vertices 2 is connected to 3,4,5,6,7. Let me think. Maybe 2 is connected to 3,4,5,6,7. So that's five vertices. But to form K3,3, we need two sets of three vertices each, all connected across. For example, suppose one partition is {1,2,5} and the other is {3,4,6}. Let's check. 1 connected to 3,4,6. 2 connected to 3,4,6. 5 connected to 3,4,6. Wait, 5 is connected to 3,4,6, yes. 1 is connected to 3,4,6. 2 is connected to 3,4,6. So each of 1,2,5 is connected to 3,4,6. So that's a K3,3. Therefore, the graph contains a K3,3 subgraph. Therefore, the graph is non-planar. So the four-color theorem applies to planar graphs, but since this is non-planar, the theorem doesn't necessarily guarantee it can be colored with four colors. But maybe it's still possible. So I need to check if it's 4-colorable.

Next, vertex 2. Its neighbors are 3,4,5,6,7. 5 is Green, so 2 can't be Green. Let's assign Blue to 2. Then, vertex 4. Vertex 4 is connected to 0,1,2,3,6. 1 is Red, 2 is Blue. So 4 can't be Red or Blue. Let's assign Green. Wait, but 5 is Green. Is 4 connected to 5? Yes, edge (4,5) exists. So 4 can't be Green because 5 is Green. Wait, I made a mistake here. Because vertex 4 is connected to vertex 5, which is Green. So if I try to assign Green to 4, that's a conflict. So 4 can't be Green. So the available colors for 4 would be Red, Blue, Yellow. But 4 is connected to 1 (Red) and 2 (Blue). So Red and Blue are taken. Therefore, 4 must be Yellow.

Are all pairs connected? 0 is connected to all. 1 is connected to 2,5,6. 2 is connected to 1,5,6. Wait, 1 and 5: edge (1,5) isn't listed. Wait, the edges for 1 are (0,1), (1,2), (1,4), (1,6), (1,7).

But perhaps this graph is non-planar. I'm not sure. But maybe it's not necessary to check planarity here, because the four-color theorem only applies to planar graphs. If the graph is non-planar, it might require more than four colors. But since the problem allows four colors, maybe we can proceed.

Since we're allowed four colors, maybe it's possible? The four-color theorem says that any planar graph can be colored with four colors. Wait, but is this graph planar? Let me check. Planar graphs can't have a subgraph that's a complete graph of five nodes (K5) or a complete bipartite graph K3,3. Let me see if there's a K5 here. Let's check if any five vertices are all connected to each other. Looking at vertex 0: connected to 1,2,4,5,7. Do any of these form a K5? Let's see 0,1,4,5,7. Are all these connected? 0 is connected to all. 1 is connected to 4,5,7. 4 is connected to 5 and 7. 5 is connected to 7. Wait, 1 and 4: yes, connected. 1 and 5: yes. 1 and 7: yes. 4 and 5: yes. 4 and 7: yes. 5 and 7: yes. So the subgraph induced by 0,1,4,5,7 would have edges between all pairs except maybe 0 and the others. Wait, 0 is connected to all of them. So 0-1,0-4,0-5,0-7. Then 1-4, 1-5, 1-7. 4-5, 4-7. 5-7. But what about between 1 and 4? Yes, connected. So in this group, each pair is connected except maybe between 0 and the others. Wait, no, 0 is connected to all. So 0 is connected to 1,4,5,7. But the other connections: 1-4, 1-5, 1-7; 4-5, 4-7; 5-7. So, for the subset {0,1,4,5,7}, each node is connected to every other except perhaps some. Let's check: 0 is connected to all in the group. 1 is connected to 0,4,5,7. 4 is connected to 0,1,5,7. 5 is connected to 0,1,4,7. 7 is connected to 0,1,4,5. Wait, so in this group, each node is connected to every other except for edges between 1 and 0 (which are connected), but in this group, 1 is connected to all except 0? Wait, no: 1 is connected to 0. Wait, no, in the group {0,1,4,5,7}, each node is connected to all others except maybe some. Wait, 0 is connected to 1,4,5,7. 1 is connected to 0,4,5,7. 4 is connected to 0,1,5,7. 5 is connected to 0,1,4,7. 7 is connected to 0,1,4,5. So every pair in this subset is connected except for like 1-4? Wait, but 1 and 4 are connected. Wait, no, the edge (1,4) is present. Similarly, 1 and 5, etc. So actually, this subset {0,1,4,5,7} forms a complete graph K5? Because each node is connected to every other node in the subset. Let's count the edges between them:

So in that case, if the partitions were {1,5,7} and {0,4,6}, then 1 is connected to all in the second partition, but 5 is connected to 0 (yes), 4 (no), 6 (yes). So 5 isn't connected to 4. Similarly, 7 is connected to 0,4,6. So 7 is connected to 0,4,6. So in this case, maybe 5 is missing connections to 4. So that's not a complete bipartite.

Let me check if there are any K5 subgraphs. Let's see. For example, vertex 1 is connected to 0,3,4,5,6,7. Let's check if any five of those form a K5. Let's take vertices 1,5,6,7, and another. For example, 1 connected to 5,6,7. 5 is connected to 6 and 7. 6 is connected to 5 and 7. So 1,5,6,7 form a K4. If there's another vertex connected to all of them, that would form K5. Let's see. Maybe vertex 4: 4 is connected to 1,5,6,7? Wait, vertex 4 is connected to 1 (yes), 5 (no, edge is 4-5? Wait, original edges: (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (4,6), (4,7). So 4 is connected to 0,1,2,6,7. So 4 is not connected to 5. So 1,5,6,7,4: 4 is connected to 1,6,7, but not to 5. So not a K5. How about 5's connections? 5 is connected to 0,1,2,3,6,7. So maybe 5,1,6,7,2. Let's check: 5 connected to 1,6,7,2. 1 connected to 5,6,7. 6 connected to 5,1,7,2. 7 connected to 5,1,6,2. 2 connected to 5,6,7. But 2 is not connected to 1. So in the group 1,2,5,6,7, vertex 2 is not connected to 1. So that's not a K5. Similarly, vertex 0 is connected to 1,4,5,7. Let's see if 0,1,4,5,7 form a K5. 0 is connected to 1,4,5,7. 1 is connected to 0,4,5,6,7. 4 is connected to 0,1,2,6,7. 5 is connected to 0,1,3,6,7. 7 is connected to 0,1,2,4,5,6. So here, for example, 4 is not connected to 5, so that group can't be a K5. So perhaps there's no K5. How about K3,3? Let's look for a bipartition of two sets of three vertices each, all connected across. Let me see. For example, vertex 0 connected to 1,4,5,7. Maybe set A: 0,1,2 and set B:4,5,6. But 0 is connected to 4,5 but not 6. 1 is connected to 4,5,6. 2 is connected to 4,5,6. So this could be a K3,3 if all connections are present. Let's check. From set A (0,1,2) to set B (4,5,6). 0 is connected to 4,5, but not 6. 1 is connected to 4,5,6. 2 is connected to 4,5,6. So 0 is missing connection to 6. So that's not a complete bipartite. What if set A is different? Let's see. Maybe set A is 1,5,7 and set B is 4,6,2. 1 is connected to 4,6. 5 is connected to 4,6. 7 is connected to 4,6. Wait, 1 is connected to 4, yes, and 6. 5 is connected to 4? Wait, 5 is connected to 4? Wait, looking back at the edges: (0,5), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (5,6), (5,7). So 5 is connected to 0,1,2,3,6,7. So 5 is not connected to 4. So 5 is not connected to 4, so that would be a problem. Hmm. Maybe another combination. Alternatively, perhaps set A is 4,5,6 and set B is 1,2,7. Let's see. 4 connected to 1,2,7? 4 is connected to 0,1,2,6,7. So yes, connected to 1,2,7. 5 connected to 1,2,7. 6 connected to 1,2,7. So set A (4,5,6) connected to set B (1,2,7). For K3,3, every vertex in A must connect to every in B. 4 connects to 1,2,7 (yes). 5 connects to 1,2,7 (yes). 6 connects to 1,2,7 (yes). So yes, that forms a K3,3. Because each of 4,5,6 is connected to each of 1,2,7. Therefore, the graph contains a K3,3 subgraph, which means it's non-planar by Kuratowski's theorem. Therefore, the four-color theorem doesn't apply here. But that doesn't necessarily mean it can't be colored with four colors. Non-planar graphs can sometimes be colored with fewer colors, but sometimes they require more. Wait, but the four-color theorem is about planar graphs. For non-planar graphs, the chromatic number could be higher. For example, K5 requires 5 colors. So if the graph contains a K5, it would require 5 colors. But since in our case, the graph contains a K3,3, which is bipartite. Wait, K3,3 is bipartite, right? So it's 2-colorable. Wait, but K3,3 is a bipartite graph, so it's 2-colorable. So even though the graph is non-planar, maybe it can still be colored with four colors. So maybe the presence of K3,3 doesn't necessarily increase the chromatic number.

Wait, the edges listed for 1,5: (1,5) is there, but 5's neighbors are 1,2,3,6. So 5 is not connected to 7. Then 7 is connected to 1,2,3,6. So 7's neighbors are 1 (Green), 2 (Blue), 3 (Yellow), 6 (Green). So 7 can't be Green, Blue, or Yellow. Therefore, 7 must be Red. So 7 is Red. But is vertex 7 connected to any Red? Let's check:

Starting with vertex 0. Let's assign it Red. Then its neighbors (1,2,3,6) can't be Red. Let's look at vertex 1. It's adjacent to 0 (Red), so it can be Green, Blue, or Yellow. Let's pick Green for vertex 1. Then vertex 2: adjacent to 0 (Red), so can be Green, Blue, Yellow. Let's choose Blue. Vertex 3: adjacent to 0 (Red) and 1 (Green). So colors available: Blue, Yellow. Let's pick Blue. Wait, but vertex 3 is connected to vertex 2 (Blue). Oh no, if I assign Blue to vertex 3, then vertex 2 and 3 would be adjacent and same color. That's a problem. So vertex 3 can't be Blue. So maybe Yellow for vertex 3. Let's try that. So vertex 3 is Yellow.

So 3 is connected to 1 and 5 in the second partition (1,2,5). But 3 is not connected to 2. So that's only two connections. Similarly, 6 is connected to 0,2,3,4,5,7. So 6 is connected to 2,5,7. If the other partition is 1,2,5, then 6 is connected to 2 and 5 but not to 1. So that's two connections. 7 is connected to 1,2,3,5,6. So 7 is connected to 1,2,5. So in this case, 7 is connected to all three in the other partition. But 3 is only connected to 1 and 5, 6 to 2 and 5. So that doesn't form a K3,3. Maybe another partition.

No, 4 is connected to 2 and 6, but 6 is connected to 4 via 0? Wait, 4 is connected to 6 through vertex 0? No, 4 and 6 are connected via edge 0-6 and 0-4, but do 4 and 6 have a direct edge? Let me check the edges. Looking back: edges include (2,4), (2,6), but (4,6) isn't listed.

So 4 is connected to 0,1,2,3,5,7. But not directly to 6. So maybe there's no K5 here. So perhaps the graph is planar. If it's planar, then by the four-color theorem, it's 4-colorable, so possible.

Wait, colors are Red, Green, Blue, Yellow. So vertex 6's adjacent colors are Green (0), Blue (1), Yellow (2), Red (4). All four colors are used by its neighbors.

For example, vertices 3,1,2,4,5: 3 is connected to all, 1 is connected to 3,4,5 but not 2. So 1 is connected to 3,4,5 but 1 isn't connected to 2. So that's not a K5.

So first step: check if the graph contains a complete graph K5. Let's look at the edges. Let's check each set of five vertices. Let's see: vertices 0 is connected to 1,2,3,5. So 0 has degree 4. Let's check if 0,1,2,3,5 form a K5. Let's see: 0 is connected to all. Now check between the others. 1 is connected to 0,3,4,5,6. So 1 is connected to 0,3,5, but not to 2. So 0-1-2-3-5 is not a K5 because 1 isn't connected to 2. Similarly, check another group. How about 1,3,5,6,7? Let's see: 1 is connected to 3,5,6. 3 is connected to 5,6,7. 5 is connected to 6,7. 6 is connected to 7. But 1 isn't connected to 7, and 1 isn't connected to 2, which isn't in this group. So that's not a K5 either. Maybe there's no K5. Similarly, K3,3? Let's see. A bipartite complete graph with partitions of size 3 each. Let me see. Maybe the graph is bipartite? But it's not because there are cycles of odd length. For example, 0-1-5-0 is a triangle. So it's not bipartite. So maybe it's non-planar but doesn't contain K5 or K3,3. Hmm. But regardless, maybe the four colors are still sufficient.

Looking at vertices 0,2,3,4,5. Let's see if they form a K5. Vertex 0 is connected to 2,3,4,5. But 2 is connected to 3,4,5; 3 is connected to 0,2,4,5; 4 is connected to 0,2,3; 5 is connected to 0,2,3. So in this group, 4 is not connected to 5. So no K5 here. Another group: 2,3,4,6,7? 2 is connected to 3,4,7; 3 connected to 2,4,6; 4 connected to 2,3,7; 6 connected to 3,7; 7 connected to 2,4,6. That's not a complete graph either. Maybe K3,3? Let's see. For K3,3, we need two sets of three nodes each, all connected between sets. Let's see. Maybe 0,2,3 and 4,5,6? Not sure. 0 is connected to 4,5,6; 2 is connected to 4,5,6,7; 3 is connected to 4,5,6. Hmm, perhaps. But 4,5,6 are connected among themselves? 4 is connected to 5? Wait, 4 is connected to 0,1,2,3,7. Wait, 4 is connected to 0,1,2,3,7. So 4 is not connected to 5. So maybe not. Maybe another set. Alternatively, maybe vertices 2,3,6 connected to 4,5,7. Let's check: 2 connected to 4,5,7? Yes. 3 connected to 4,5,6. 6 connected to 4? Wait, 6 is connected to 4? Let me check the edge list. The edges for 6 are (0,6), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (6,7). So 6 is connected to 0,1,2,3,7. Not to 4 or 5. So 6 is not connected to 4. So maybe that's not a K3,3 either. Hmm. Maybe the graph is planar, so it's 4-colorable. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe trying to construct the coloring would be faster.

Looking at the edges, maybe vertices 3,5,7 connected to 0,4,6. Wait, 3 is connected to 0,4,6, but also to 1,2,5,7. Let me check. Suppose we have partitions A = {3,5,7} and B = {0,4,6}. Then each in A should be connected to each in B. 3 is connected to 0,4,6 (yes). 5 is connected to 0? No, 5 is connected to 0 via edge (0,5)? Wait, no. Let me check the original edges. The given edges for 5: (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (6,5), (7,5). So 5 is connected to 1,2,3,4,6,7. So 5 is not connected to 0. So in the partition A = {3,5,7}, B = {0,4,6}, 5 is not connected to 0. So that doesn't work. Maybe another partition. Let's try A = {1,2,5} and B = {3,6,7}. Check if each in A connects to each in B. 1 is connected to 3,6, but not 7. So that's not K3,3. Maybe another combination. It's getting complicated. Maybe this graph is planar. Alternatively, maybe it's non-planar, but even then, since we have four colors, maybe it's colorable with four colors. Wait, but if it's non-planar, the four-color theorem doesn't apply, but the question allows four colors. So perhaps regardless of planarity, maybe it's possible.

Let me try to assign colors in order, starting from the highest degree vertices because they have the most constraints. So vertices 4 and 7 have degree 6. Let's start with vertex 4. Assign color Red.

Let's assign Blue. Then vertex 2 (degree 5) is connected to 4 (Red) and 7 (Green). So possible colors: Blue, Yellow. Let's assign Yellow. Then vertex 5 (degree 5) is connected to 4 (Red), 2 (Yellow), 7 (Green). So possible color: Blue. Assign Blue. Vertex 3 (degree 4) is connected to 1 (Blue), 4 (Red), 5 (Blue).

Wait, 4 is connected to 7? Let me check the edge list. Edge (4,7) isn't listed. Wait, original edges: (0,7), (1,7), (2,7), (3,7), (5,7), (6,7). So 7 is connected to 0,1,2,3,5,6.

Wait, so vertex 4 has degree 6, connected to 0,1,2,3,5,6. That's a high degree. Similarly, vertex 5 is connected to 2,3,4,6,7—degree 5. Vertex 7 is connected to 0,1,2,3,5,6—degree 6. So some vertices have high degrees. Let me check if the graph contains a complete subgraph with five vertices. A complete graph K5 would require that every pair is connected. Let's see. Take vertices 0,1,2,3,4. But 0 isn't connected to 1, for example. So maybe not K5. How about K4? Let's see. Vertex 4 is connected to 0,1,2,3,5,6. So maybe vertex 4 is part of multiple K4s. For example, 4 is connected to 0,2,7. But 0 and 2 are connected. Wait, maybe 4,0,2,7: 0-2, 0-4, 0-7, 2-4, 2-7, 4-7. Hmm, that's a K4? Let's check: 0 connected to 2,4,7; 2 connected to 0,4,7; 4 connected to 0,2,7; 7 connected to 0,2,4. Yes, that's a complete subgraph K4. So the graph contains a K4, which would require at least 4 colors. So since we have four colors, that's okay. But if there's a K5, we'd need five colors, but I don't think there's a K5 here.

Wait, but the other seven vertices can't all have unique colors because we have only four colors. Wait, but each of those seven adjacent vertices can have colors from the four, but vertex 5 just needs a color different from each of them.

At the point of coloring 7, adjacent to 2 (Red), and also adjacent to 3 (Green). So 7 can't be Red or Green. So possible colors: Blue or Yellow. But vertex 5 is Blue, and 7 is adjacent to 5? Let me check: Edge (5,7) is present. Yes, 5 is connected to 7. So 5 is Blue, so 7 can't be Blue. Therefore, 7 must be Yellow.

Looking at the graph, let's see if there's a K5. For a K5, we need five vertices each connected to every other. Let's check the adjacency of vertices. Let's see, vertex 2 is connected to 1,3,4,5,6,7. So it has six edges. Let's check if any group of five vertices forms a complete subgraph. For example, vertices 2,3,5,7, maybe? Let's see. Vertex 2 is connected to 3,5,7. Vertex 3 is connected to 5 and 7. Vertex 5 is connected to 7. So that's not a complete graph because in K5, every pair must be connected. So here, 2-3-5-7: 2 is connected to all, 3 is connected to 5 and 7, but is 5 connected to 7? Let's check the edges. The edges given for 5: (0,5), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,6). So 5 is not connected to 7. So 5-7 isn't an edge. Therefore, that's not a K5. Maybe another group. Let's see. How about 0,3,4,5,7. 0 is connected to 3,4,5,7. 3 is connected to 0,4? Let's check. Wait, 3's edges: (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7). So 3 is connected to 0,1,2,5,6,7. So 3 is not connected to 4. So 3 and 4 are not connected. So that group can't be K5. How about 2,3,5,6,7? 2 is connected to all except maybe 6. Wait, 2 is connected to 3,4,5,6,7. So in that group, 2 is connected to 3,5,6,7. Then 3 is connected to 5,6,7. 5 is connected to 6. 6 is connected to 3 and 5. 7 is connected to 2,3, but not 5 or 6. So 7 is connected to 2,3 but not 5,6. So not a complete graph. So perhaps there's no K5.

Looking at edges between 2,3,4,5,6,7. For example, 2 is connected to 5,7 (from edges 2-5, 2-7). 3 is connected to 5,7 (3-5, 3-7). 4 is connected to 6,7 (4-6,4-7). 5 is connected to 6,7 (5-6,5-7). 6 is connected to 7 via 5-7 and 4-7? Wait, 6 is connected to 5 and 4. 7 is connected to 0,2,3,4,5. So in the neighbors of 0, the connections are not all present. For example, 2 is not connected to 3,4,6. 3 isn't connected to 4,6. 4 isn't connected to 2,3,5. 5 is connected to 2,3,6,7. 6 is connected to 4,5,7. 7 is connected to 2,3,4,5. So no, the neighbors of 0 don't form a complete graph. So Brooks' theorem says that if the graph is not a complete graph or an odd cycle, then it can be colored with Δ colors. The maximum degree here is 6, but the graph isn't a complete graph (since, as we saw, neighbors of 0 aren't all connected). So Brooks' theorem would suggest that it can be colored with 6 colors, but we have four. So that doesn't directly help. But maybe the graph can be colored with fewer colors. Let's try to find a coloring.

However, vertex 0 and vertex 1 are **not** adjacent (checking the original edges: 0 is connected to 4,5,6 only). Therefore, vertex 1 can indeed be Green without conflict.

But wait, vertex 7 is Green, and vertex 3 is connected to 0,1,4,5,6. So 3 is connected to 0, which is yet to be colored. But 3 is Green. Let's check if 3 is adjacent to any Green? Vertex 7 isn't adjacent to 3. Wait, the edges: (3,7) isn't in the edge list. Wait, checking the edges for 3: (0,3), (1,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6). No, 3 is not connected to 7. So assigning Green to 3 is okay so far. But 3 is connected to 0, which is adjacent to 3. So when we get to 0, we need to remember that it can't be Green.

Assign color Red to node 6. Now, all its neighbors (1,2,3,4,5,7) can't be red. Then node 7 is connected to 6 (Red), so it needs a different color. Let's assign Blue to 7. Then node 5 is connected to 6 (Red) and 7 (Blue). So 5 can't be Red or Blue. Let's assign Green to 5. Node 4 is connected to 5 (Green), 6 (Red), and 7 (Blue). So 4 can't be Green, Red, or Blue. So it has to be Yellow. Then node 3 is connected to 4 (Yellow), 5 (Green), 6 (Red). So 3 can't be Yellow, Green, or Red. So it needs to be Blue. But wait, node 3 is connected to 7 (Blue). Wait, node 3 is connected to 7? Let me check: the edges for node 3 are (0,3), (1,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6). So node 3 is not connected to 7.

Looking for triangles: Let's check if three nodes are all connected. For example, 3,4,5: 3 is connected to 4 and 5, and 4 is connected to 5. So 3-4-5 forms a triangle. Therefore, the graph contains triangles, which means it's not bipartite (since bipartite graphs can't have odd-length cycles). So the chromatic number is at least 3.

But vertex 1 is connected to 0 (Green), 2,4 (Red),6,7. So vertex 1 can't be Green or Red. So it must be Blue or Yellow. Let's pick Blue for vertex 1.

Let's assign vertex 2 to Yellow. Then, vertex 2 is connected to 1 (Blue),4 (Red),5,6,7. So vertex 2 is Yellow, so its neighbors can't be Yellow. So vertex 5,6,7 connected to 2 can't be Yellow. But vertex 5 is connected to 0 (Green), 2 (Yellow),4 (Red), and 7. So vertex 5 can't be Green, Yellow, or Red. Therefore, vertex 5 must be Blue.

But actually, the four-color theorem says that any planar graph can be colored with four colors. Wait, but is this graph planar? Let me think. Planar graphs cannot have a subgraph that's a complete graph of five nodes (K5). Let's check if this graph has a K5. Let's see: vertex 4 is connected to 0,1,2,3,5,6,7. So any five-node subset including 4 and four others. For example, 4,0,1,2,3. Are these all connected? 0 is connected to 1,3,4; 1 is connected to 0,2,4; 2 is connected to 1,4; 3 is connected to 0,4. So in this subset, 4 is connected to all, but 0 is connected to 1 and 3, 1 is connected to 2 and 0, 2 is connected to 1 and 4, etc. But not all nodes are connected to each other. So maybe not a K5. Similarly, 4,0,1,5,6: 0 connected to 1,5,6; 1 connected to 0,5,6; 5 connected to 0,4,6; 6 connected to 0,1,4,5. Not a complete graph. So maybe the graph is planar. But I'm not sure.

So 4 can't be Red, Green, or Yellow. So it must be Blue. So vertex 4 is Blue. But vertex 4 is connected to vertex 2 (Blue), which is a problem! Vertex 2 and 4 are both Blue, but they are connected via an edge (0-4 and 2-4? Wait, wait. Wait, vertex 2 is connected to 4? Let me check the edges again.

Looking for K5: A complete graph with 5 vertices where each pair is connected. Let's see. Let's check vertex 0. It's connected to 1,2,3,5,7. So 0's neighbors are 1,2,3,5,7. Are any of these five vertices forming a complete subgraph? Let's check if 1 is connected to 2: No, because edge (1,2) isn't listed. So 0's neighbors don't form a K5. How about vertex 1? Its neighbors are 0,3,4,5,6,7. Let's check if any five of these form a K5. For example, 0,3,4,5,7. But 0 is connected to 3,4 (no, 0 is not connected to 4. Wait, 0's edges are (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,5), (0,7). So 0 is connected to 1,2,3,5,7, but not to 4 or 6. So 0 is not connected to 4. So in 1's neighbors, 0 is connected to 3,5,7, but 4 is connected to 1, but 0 and 4 are not connected. So maybe not a K5. Similarly, vertex 7 has neighbors 0,1,2,4,5,6. Checking if any subset of five of these form a K5. Let's see: 0,1,2,4,5. Are they all connected? 0 is connected to 1,2,5. 0 is not connected to 4. 1 is connected to 0,2? No, 1 isn't connected to 2.

Alternative approach: Let's check if the subgraph has a clique of size 4. If there's a K4, then it would require 4 colors. Let's see. For example, vertices 0,1,2,4. Are they all connected? 0 connected to 1,2,4. 1 connected to 0,2,4. 2 connected to 0,1,4. 4 connected to 0,1,2. But 1 and 2 are connected? Wait, in the subgraph, edges between 1 and 2? Looking back, in the subgraph (excluding edges to 7), the edges for 1 are (0,1), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5). So 1 is not connected to 2 in the subgraph. So the subgraph does not have a K4. So maybe it's 3-colorable.

Let's check for K5. Any five vertices where each is connected to every other. Let's see. Take vertices 0,1,2,4,7. Vertex 0 is connected to 1,2,4,7. But 1 is connected to 0,2,4,5,7. Wait, 0,1,2,4,7: 0 is connected to 1,2,4,7. 1 is connected to 0,2,4, but not to 7 (wait, no, 1 is connected to 7). So 0,1,2,4,7: each pair except maybe 2 and 7. Wait, 2 is connected to 7. So in this set, 0 connected to all, 1 connected to 0,2,4,7, 2 connected to 0,1,4,7, 4 connected to 0,1,2,7, and 7 connected to all. So this is K5? Because all pairs are connected except maybe between 1 and 2: wait, 1 and 2 are connected? In the original edges, is there (1,2)? Looking back at the edges: the edges given are (0,1), (0,2), (0,4), (0,6), (0,7), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,7), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,7), (3,5), (3,7), (4,6), (4,7), (5,7), (6,7). So there's no edge between 1 and 2. So in the set 0,1,2,4,7, the missing edges are 1-2, 1-4 (no, 1-4 is present), 1-7 is present, 2-4 is present, etc. Wait, 0 is connected to all. 1 is connected to 0,3,4,5,7. So 1 is not connected to 2. So in the set 0,1,2,4,7, the edges missing are 1-2 and 2-4? No, 2-4 is present. So 1 is not connected to 2. Therefore, this is not a K5. Similarly, check for K3,3. Maybe a bipartition. For example, if there's a subset of three vertices connected to three others all. Let's see. For instance, vertices 1,2,3 connected to 4,5,7. But I'm not sure.

1 is connected to 3,5,7 (from edges (1,3), (1,5), (1,7)), but is 1 connected to 6? Yes, via edge (0,6) is between 0 and 6, but 1 is connected to 6? Let me check the edge list. The edges for 1 are (0,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,5), (1,7). So 1 is not directly connected to 6. So the neighbors of 0 (excluding 0 itself) are 1,3,5,6,7. 1 is not connected to 6, so that's not a complete subgraph. Similarly, maybe check another group. Maybe vertex 6's connections? It's connected to 0,2,3,4,5,7. Let's see if those form a K6, which is impossible for planarity. But even a K5 within that? Let's check if any five of 0,2,3,4,5,7 are fully connected. For example, 0 is connected to 2? No. 0 is connected to 3,5,6,7. Wait, 0 is connected to 3,5,6,7 but not to 2 or 4. So 0 is not part of a K5. How about vertex 6's neighbors: 0,2,3,4,5,7. Let's check if any five of these form a complete subgraph. Take 3,4,5,7,0. Do they all connect? 3 is connected to 4,5,7,0. 4 is connected to 3,6,7,2, but not necessarily to 5. Wait, edge (4,5) is not listed. The edges for 4 are (2,4), (3,4), (4,6), (4,7). So 4 is connected to 2,3,6,7. So 4 is not connected to 5. Therefore, the subset 3,4,5,7,0 would not form a K5. Similarly, other combinations. Maybe the graph is planar. But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The four-color theorem applies to planar graphs, but if the graph is non-planar, maybe it's still 4-colorable, but the theorem doesn't guarantee it. However, given that the user is allowing four colors, maybe it's possible regardless. Wait, but the four-color theorem is for planar graphs. If the graph is non-planar, maybe it's not 4-colorable? No, actually, non-planar graphs can still be 4-colorable. For example, K5 is non-planar and requires 5 colors, but K3,3 is bipartite and can be colored with 2 colors. So the presence of a non-planar subgraph might require more colors.

0 is connected to 1, 2, 6,7. So 0 is connected to 1, but not to 3,4,5. So the neighbors of 2 (0,1,3,4,5) are not all connected to each other, so the subgraph induced by 2's neighbors isn't a complete graph. Similarly, checking for vertex 3: neighbors are 2,4,5,6,7. Are these all connected? 2 is connected to 4,5; 4 is connected to 5,6,7; 5 is connected to 6,7. But 2 is not connected to 6 or 7, so again, not a complete graph. So Brooks' theorem would say that the graph can be colored with Δ = 5 colors. But the question is about 4 colors. So maybe it's possible with fewer colors? Brooks' theorem gives an upper bound, but the actual chromatic number could be lower.

Then its neighbors (0,1,3,4,5,7) can't be Green. Now, vertex 0 is connected to 1 (Red) and 6 (Green), so it can't be Red or Green. Let's assign Blue to 0.

Wait, no. Wait the edges for 2 are: (0,2), (1,2), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7). So 2 is connected to 0,1,4,5,6,7. So 2 is not connected to 3. Wait, but in the edge list, there's (1,3) and (0,3), but 2 is not connected to 3. Wait, so the vertices 0,2,3,5,7: 0 is connected to 2,3,5,7. 2 is connected to 0,5,7 but not 3. 3 is connected to 0,1,4,5,7. 5 is connected to 0,1,2,3,7. 7 is connected to 0,2,3,5,6,4.

So if we take the partitions as {4,5,6} and {0,1,7}, then 4 is connected to 0,1,7; 5 is connected to 0,1,7; 6 is connected to 0? Wait, no. 6 is connected to 0? Let me check. The edges for 6: 3,4,5,7.

Wait, each of these five vertices (0,1,2,4,5) is connected to each other except for 4 and 2? Wait no, vertex 4 is connected to 2 via (0,4) and (0,2), but wait, does vertex 4 connect directly to 2? Wait, looking back at edges: (0,4) and (0,2) exist, but (2,4) is not listed. Wait, the edges given are (0,1), (0,2), (0,4), (0,5), (0,7), (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (1,7), (2,3), (2,5), (3,4), (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,6), (6,7). So, vertex 4 is connected to 0,1,3,5,6,7. So, vertex 4 is not directly connected to 2.

So in this subgraph, vertices 2 and 4 are not connected. So that's not a complete graph. Similarly, check if there is a K5 elsewhere. Maybe 0,1,4,5,7? Let's see. 0 connected to 1,4,5,7; 1 connected to 0,4,5,7; 4 connected to 0,1,5,7; 5 connected to 0,1,4; 7 connected to 0,1,4. So 5 isn't connected to 7, and 4 is connected to all except maybe 7? Wait, 4 is connected to 7. So 4 is connected to 0,1,3,5,6,7. So in the subset 0,1,4,5,7, 5 is not connected to 7. So, no K5 here.

Wait, vertex 4 is Red and vertex 6 is connected to vertex 4? Wait, looking back at edges, vertex 4 is connected to 1,2,3. Wait, no, vertex 4 is connected via edges (1,4), (2,4), (3,4). So vertex 4 is connected to 1,2,3 but not to 6. Wait, so vertex 6 is connected to 1,2,3,5,7. So 6 is not connected to 4. So vertex 6 can be Red, since it's not adjacent to 4. So assign Red to vertex 6. But wait, vertex 6 is connected to 5 (Blue), so that's okay. Then, vertex 7 is connected to 1 (Green), 2 (Blue), 5 (Blue), 6 (Red).

Let's try a different color for vertex 5. Instead of Yellow, maybe Blue. Wait, vertex 2 is Blue, and vertex 5 is connected to 2 (edge between 2 and 5?

Wait, vertex 2 is connected to 0,1,4,6,7. There's no edge between 2 and 5. So vertex 5 isn't adjacent to 2. Therefore, if I assigned vertex 5 to Blue, that's okay. Wait, but in my initial assignment, vertex 2 was Blue, and vertex 5 is not adjacent to 2, so that's allowed. Let me check again.

So the subgraph among 5's neighbors is not complete. So K6 is not present. How about K5 or K3,3? Let's see. Maybe there's a K5 somewhere. Let's check for a complete subgraph with 5 vertices. For example, vertices 0,1,2,3,4. Do they form a complete graph? 0 is connected to 1,2,4, but not to 3. So that's not a K5.

5 is connected to all of them. So in this subset, 0 is missing an edge to 3. So that's not a complete K5. Similarly, maybe another subset.

So that's not a K5 either. So maybe the graph is planar. If it's planar, then four colors should suffice. But I'm not sure. Maybe I should just try to color it step by step.

So 1 is connected to 0,2,3,4,7. So 1 is not connected to 5. So 0,1,2,4,5 would need 1 connected to 5, which isn't the case. So not a K5. Similarly, checking for K3,3. Maybe another way.

Looking at the edges: 2 is connected to 0,1,3,5. Not connected to 4. So 0,1,2,4 isn't a K4. Hmm. Maybe 1,3,4,5? Let's check. 1 is connected to 3,4. 3 is connected to 4,5. 4 is connected to 5.

Let me check the edges. In the original edge list, vertex 5 is connected to 2, 3, 4, 7. Wait, in the subgraph (excluding 7), 5 is connected to 2,3,4. So 5 is not connected to 6 in the subgraph.

Are they all connected to each other? 0 is connected to 1,2 (no, 0 is connected to 1, but 0 and 2: looking at edges, (0,1) exists, but (0,2) is not listed. Wait, edges for 0 are (0,1), (0,3), (0,4), (0,6), (0,7). So 0 isn't connected to 2 or 5. So 0 is connected to 1,3,4,6,7. So the neighbors of 4 include 0,1,2,3,5,6,7.

Take vertices 0,1,2,6,7. Let's see if they form a clique. 0 connected to 1: yes. 0 connected to 2: no. So that's not a clique. How about 2,4,5,6,7? 2 is connected to 4,5,6,7. 4 is connected to 5,6,7. 5 connected to 6 and 7. 6 connected to 7. So 2,5,6,7 and 4. Wait, 2 is connected to 4, yes. 5 is connected to 4. 6 and 7 are connected to 4. So maybe 4,5,6,7 form a clique? Let's check. 4 connected to 5: yes. 4-6: yes. 4-7: yes. 5-6: yes. 5-7: yes. 6-7: yes. So 4,5,6,7 form a 4-clique (complete graph K4). So that's a 4-clique. So that requires 4 colors. But since the problem allows 4 colors, that's okay. But if there's a 5-clique, then we need 5 colors, which we don't have. But since the maximum clique size here is 4, then 4 colors should suffice.

First, looking at the edges provided. Vertex 0 is connected to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. That's six edges from vertex 0. So vertex 0 has degree 6. That's quite high. Then, looking at vertex 1: it's connected to 0, 3, 5, 6, 7. That's five edges. Similarly, vertex 3 is connected to 0,1,4,6,7—also five edges. Vertex 4 is connected to 0,2,3,5,6,7—six edges.

Vertex 4 is connected to 0 (Red), 2 (Blue), 3 (Blue?), 5,6,7. Wait, if vertex 3 is Blue, then vertex 4 can't be Blue. So vertex 4 needs to be a color that's not Red, Blue, or whatever else. Wait, vertex 4 is connected to 0 (Red), 2 (Blue), and 3 (if Blue). So vertex 4 can't be Red or Blue. So possible colors: Green or Yellow. Let's choose Green for vertex 4. But then, vertex 4 is connected to vertex 1 (Green). Wait, vertex 1 is connected to vertex 4? Let me check. The edges for vertex 1 are (0,1), (1,3), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7). So no, vertex 1 is not connected to vertex 4. So vertex 4 being Green is okay, since it's only connected to 0 (Red), 2 (Blue), and 3 (Blue). So Green is allowed. Then, vertex 4 is Green. So then, vertex 5 is connected to 0 (Red), 1 (Green), 4 (Green). So vertex 5 can't be Red or Green. Assign Blue or Yellow. Let's try Blue. But vertex 5 is connected to 1 (Green), 4 (Green), and 0 (Red). Assigning Blue to 5. Then vertex 6 is connected to 0 (Red), 1 (Green), 3 (Blue), 4 (Green), 5 (Blue), 7. So vertex 6 can't be Red, Green, or Blue. So only Yellow left. Assign Yellow to vertex 6. Then vertex 7 is connected to 1 (Green), 2 (Blue), 3 (Blue), 4 (Green), 6 (Yellow).

So 1 is not connected to 5. Therefore, 1 and 5 are not connected. So that's not a K5. Similarly, maybe 2,3,5,6,7? 2 is connected to all of these.

Vertex 3 is connected to 0 (unknown), 2 (Red), 4 (Green), 7 (Blue). So vertex 3 can't be Red, Green, Blue. So also Yellow. Wait, but vertex 3 is connected to vertex 1 (Yellow), which is adjacent. Wait, no, vertex 1 and vertex 3 are connected? Let me check the edges. The edges for vertex 3 are (0,3), (2,3), (3,4), (3,7). So vertex 3 is not connected to vertex 1. So vertex 3 can be Yellow, even if vertex 1 is Yellow. Wait, no, because if vertex 1 and 3 are not connected, they can have the same color. So vertex 3 can be Yellow. So assign Yellow to vertex 3.

Looking at this, vertex 0 is connected to 2,3,5,6,7. So degree 5. Vertex 1 is connected to 2,3,4,6. Degree 4. Vertex 2 is connected to 0,1,3,4,5,6,7. That's degree 7! Wow, vertex 2 is connected to almost everyone except maybe vertex 1? Wait, vertex 2 is connected to 0,1,3,4,5,6,7. Wait, vertex 2 has edges to 0,1,3,4,5,6,7. So that's 7 edges. So vertex 2 is the most connected. Then vertex 4 is connected to 1,2,5,6,7. Degree 5. Vertex 5 is connected to 0,2,3,4,6. Degree 5. Vertex 6 is connected to 0,1,2,4,5,7.

Vertex 6 is connected to 0 (Green), 1 (Green), 2 (Red), 4 (Blue), 5 (Yellow), and 7. So vertex 6 can't be Green, Red, Blue, or Yellow? Wait, that's all four colors. That's a problem. Because 6 is connected to 0 (Green), 1 (Green), 2 (Red), 4 (Blue), 5 (Yellow). So all four colors are used by its neighbors. That's impossible. So vertex 6 can't be colored.

So 0 and 4 are not connected. So vertex 4 can be colored Green? Wait, but in the order, after 2 and 0. So vertex 4 is next. It's connected to 2 (Red) and others. So can't be Red. But since it's not connected to 0 (Green), so possible colors: Green, Blue, Yellow. Let's assign Green. Wait, but vertex 4 is connected to 1, but vertex 1 hasn't been colored yet.

Then, its neighbors (1,5,6) cannot be Red. Let's color vertex 1 Green. Then, vertex 5 and 6 can't be Red or Green, so they have to be Blue. But wait, vertex 5 is connected to vertex 0 (Red) and vertex 1 (Green). So vertex 5 could be Blue. Similarly, vertex 6 is connected to 0 (Red) and 1 (Green), so also Blue. But let's assign vertex 5 as Blue and vertex 6 as Blue. However, vertex 5 and 6 are connected by an edge (5-6). So both can't be Blue. Oh right! So that's a conflict.

But vertex 2 is connected to 6, which we haven't colored yet. Wait, 6 is connected to 0 (Red), 2,3 (Blue), 4 (Yellow), 5,7. So 6 can't be Red, Blue, or Yellow. So 6 must be Green. Then 2 can't be Green (since connected to 6). So 2 must be Red. But 2 is connected to 3 (Blue), 4 (Yellow), and 6 (Green). So Red is okay for 2. So let's assign:

So vertex 6 is the most connected, with degree 7. That might be important. Since it's connected to all other vertices except maybe none? Wait, no, 6 is connected to all 7 others. So vertex 6 is adjacent to every other vertex. That means that when we color vertex 6, it must have a color different from all other vertices. But since we have 4 colors, and vertex 6 is connected to 7 vertices, but each of those 7 can only take 3 other colors. Wait, but the four-color theorem says that planar graphs are 4-colorable. Wait, but is this graph planar? Hmm, planar graphs can't have a subgraph that's a complete graph of 5 nodes (K5). Let me check if there's a K5 here. For example, vertex 6 is connected to all others. Let's see: if any 5 vertices form a complete subgraph. For example, 0,2,3,6,7. Are they all connected? 0 is connected to 2,3,6,7. 2 is connected to 0,3,6,7. 3 is connected to 0,2,6,7. 6 is connected to all. 7 is connected to 0,2,3,6. So in this subset, each is connected to each other except maybe between some? Wait, 0 and 7 are connected. 0 and 2 are connected. 0 and 3. 2 and 3. 2 and 7. 3 and 7. So in this subset of 5 nodes (0,2,3,6,7), each pair is connected except maybe 0 and 5? Wait, 5 isn't in this subset. Wait, the subset is 0,2,3,6,7. So in this group, 0 is connected to 2,3,6,7. 2 is connected to 0,3,6,7. 3 is connected to 0,2,6,7. 6 is connected to all. 7 is connected to 0,2,3,6. So actually, all pairs in this subset are connected except 0 and 7? Wait, no, 0 is connected to 7. Wait, edge (0,7) is present. Then in this subset of 5 nodes, every pair is connected. So that's a K5. If so, then the graph is non-planar. Because K5 is non-planar. But the four-color theorem applies to planar graphs, but this graph might not be planar. However, the question isn't about planar graphs; it's just any graph. So the four-color theorem doesn't apply here. So even though it's non-planar, we can still check if it's 4-colorable. Some non-planar graphs are 4-colorable. For example, K5 is 5-chromatic, so it requires 5 colors. But if this graph contains a K5, then it would need at least 5 colors. Wait, but does this graph have a K5 subgraph?

Alternatively, maybe check if the graph contains a complete graph of size 4 (K4), which would require four colors. Let me see. For example, vertices 0,1,2,3: are they all connected to each other? 0 is connected to 1,2,3. 1 is connected to 0,2,3. 2 is connected to 0,1,3. 3 is connected to 0,1,2. So yes, these four form a K4. So that's a complete graph on four vertices, which means each of these four must have different colors. Therefore, vertices 0,1,2,3 each need distinct colors. Since we have four colors, that's possible: assign each a different color. Then the remaining vertices (4,5,6,7) can be colored based on their neighbors.

Similarly, 2 is connected to 1 and 3. 3 is connected to 1 and 2. So 1,2,3 form a triangle (K3). Then, each of them is connected to 0, but that's a K4? Wait, K4 is planar.

Looking at the edges, let's check for K5. A complete graph on five vertices would have each vertex connected to every other. Let's look at vertices 0,1,2,3,5. Vertex 0 is connected to 1,2,3,5. But 1 is connected to 0,2,3,4,6,7. Wait, but in the subset 0,1,2,3,5: 0 is connected to all except 4,6,7. But 1 is connected to 0,2,3, but not to 5. Wait, 1 is connected to 0,2,3, but not to 5. So that subset isn't a K5. How about another subset? Let's see vertices 1,2,3,6,7. 1 is connected to 2,3,6,7. 2 is connected to 1,3,6,7. 3 is connected to 1,2,6,7. 6 is connected to 1,2,3. 7 is connected to 1,2,3. So in this subset, 1,2,3 are all connected to each other and to 6,7. But 6 and 7 are not connected. Wait, 6 is connected to 7? Let me check the edge list. The edges for 6 are 1,2,3,4,5. So 6 is not connected to 7. Similarly, 7 is connected to 1,2,3. So the subset 1,2,3,6,7: 1-2-3 form a K3 among themselves, but connections to 6 and 7 are not complete. So that's not a K5.

Wait, how to check if this graph is planar? For planar graphs, Kuratowski's theorem says that a graph is planar if and only if it does not contain a subgraph that is a subdivision of K5 or K3,3. Let me see. Let's check if there's a K5 here. K5 has 5 vertices each with degree 4 (since each is connected to the other four). Looking at vertices 1 and 3, which have degree 6. Let's see their neighbors. Vertex 1 is connected to 0,2,3,4,6,7. Vertex 3 is connected to 0,1,2,4,6,7. So if we look at the subgraph induced by, say, vertices 1,3,0,2,4. Let's see: 1 is connected to 0,2,3,4; 3 is connected to 0,1,2,4; 0 is connected to 1,3; 2 is connected to 1,3,4; 4 is connected to 1,2,3. Hmm, that's a K5? Let me check the edges between these five. Wait, 0 is connected to 1 and 3 only. So in this subset, 0 is only connected to 1 and 3. 1 is connected to all except maybe 0. Wait, in this subset, 1 is connected to 0,2,3,4. So 1 has four edges. Similarly, 3 is connected to 0,1,2,4. 2 is connected to 1,3,4. 4 is connected to 1,2,3. 0 is connected to 1,3. So this isn't a complete graph, because 0 isn't connected to 2,4. So it's not K5. How about K3,3? Let's see if there's a bipartition of 3 and 3 vertices with all edges between them. Let's see. For example, vertices 1,3,7 and 0,2,6. Wait, but I need to see if each in one set connects to all in the other. Let me check: 1 is connected to 0,2,6,7. 3 is connected to 0,2,6,7. 7 is connected to 0,1,3,5,6. So if the set is {1,3,7} and {0,2,6}, then 1 connects to 0,2,6; 3 connects to 0,2,6; 7 connects to 0,6. So 7 doesn't connect to 2. So that's not a complete bipartite. Maybe another set. Let's try {1,3,6} and {0,2,7}. 1 connects to 0,2,7; 3 connects to 0,2,7; 6 connects to 0,7. So 6 doesn't connect to 2. Hmm, not K3,3. Maybe another combination. Alternatively, maybe the original graph is planar. Alternatively, maybe it's non-planar. But given that it's hard to see a K5 or K3,3 subdivision, perhaps it is planar. But maybe I should try to apply Euler's formula. For planar graphs, the number of edges must be less than or equal to 3n - 6, where n is the number of vertices. Here, n=8, so 3*8 -6 = 18. The given edges: let's count them. The edge list is:

Alternatively, maybe I should just try to color it step by step. Let's start with vertex 0. Let's assign a color to it, say Red. Then its neighbors (1,2,3,5,7) can't be red. Let's look at vertex 1. It's connected to 0 (Red), so it can be Green, Blue, or Yellow. Let's pick Green for vertex 1. Then vertex 2 is connected to both 0 (Red) and 1 (Green). So it can be Blue or Yellow. Let's choose Blue. Then vertex 3 is connected to 0 (Red), 1 (Green), and 2 (Blue). So it can't be those colors; it has to be Yellow. Then vertex 5 is connected to 0 (Red) and 3 (Yellow). So it can be Green or Blue. Let me pick Green for vertex 5. Then vertex 7 is connected to 0 (Red), 1 (Green), 2 (Blue), 5 (Green). So it can't be Red, Green, or Blue. So the only color left is Yellow. But wait, vertex 7 is connected to 5 (Green) and 3 (Yellow). So 7 can't be Yellow either? Wait, no. Vertex 3 is Yellow, but is vertex 3 connected to 7? Let me check. The edges for vertex 3 are (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (3,5). So vertex 3 is not connected to 7. Therefore, vertex 7 is connected to 0,1,2,5, which are Red, Green, Blue, Green.

3: Can't be Red (connected to 0) or Blue (connected to 2). So 3 must be Green. But vertex 1 is already Green, and vertex 3 is connected to vertex 1? Wait, in the subgraph, vertex 3 is connected to vertex 1? Let me check. In the original edges, vertex 3 is connected to 0,2,4,5,6,7. But in the induced subgraph without 6, the connections are 0,2,4,5,7. So vertex 3 is not connected to vertex 1 in the induced subgraph. Wait, that's a mistake. Earlier, I thought vertex 3 is connected to 1, but in reality, in the original graph, vertex 3 is connected to 0,2,4,5,6,7. So in the subgraph without 6, vertex 3 is connected to 0,2,4,5,7. So vertex 3 is not connected to 1. Therefore, assigning vertex 3 to Green (same as vertex 1) is okay, because they are not adjacent. Wait, but vertex 1 is connected to vertex 3? Wait, in the original edges, vertex 1 is connected to 0,2,4,6. So vertex 1 is not connected to 3. So vertex 1 and 3 are not adjacent. So assigning both to Green is okay. Then proceeding.

Wait, 2,4,5,7: 2 is connected to 4,5,7. 4 is connected to 5 and 7. 5 is connected to 4 and 2, but 5 is not connected to 7. Wait, in the edges given, (5,7) isn't listed. Wait, checking the original edges: yes, the edges for 2 are (2,4), (2,5), (2,7); 4 is connected to 5 and 7; 5 is connected to 4, but not to 7. So 2,4,5,7: 2-4, 2-5, 2-7, 4-5, 4-7, but 5-7 is not an edge. So that's a 4-node clique missing one edge. So not a complete graph. So maximum clique size is 3? For example, 2,4,5: 2-4, 2-5, 4-5. Yes, that's a triangle. Similarly, 4,5,7: 4-5, 4-7, 5-7? Wait, 5-7 isn't an edge. Hmm. Wait, edges for 4: (3,4), (4,5), (4,7). So 4 is connected to 5 and 7, but 5 and 7 are not connected. So 4,5,7 is not a clique. So maybe maximum clique size is 3. Then, according to graph coloring, if the graph is 3-colorable, then it can be colored with 3 colors. Let's try.

Now checking for K3,3. A complete bipartite graph with partitions of size 3. Let's see. For example, take partitions (0,1,2) and (3,4,5). Check if every vertex in the first partition is connected to every vertex in the second. 0 connected to 3: yes. 0 connected to 4: no. 0 is connected to 3,5, but not 4. So that's not K3,3. How about partitions (2,5,6) and (1,4,7)? Let's see. 2 connected to 1: yes. 2 connected to 4: yes. 2 connected to 7: yes. 5 connected to 1: yes. 5 connected to 4: yes. 5 connected to 7: no. So 5-7 missing. Not a K3,3. Maybe another set. How about (2,5,7) and (1,4,6)? 2 connected to 1,4,6: 2-1 yes, 2-4 yes, 2-6 yes. 5 connected to 1,4,6: 5-1 yes, 5-4 yes, 5-6 yes. 7 connected to 1,4,6: 7-1 yes, 7-4 no (7's edges are 0,1,2,6), so 7-4 missing. So not K3,3. Hmm.

Hmm. Let's check if there's a K5 subgraph. For example, let's see if any five vertices are all connected to each other. Let's check vertices 0,2,5, maybe others. Wait, vertex 2 is connected to 0,1,4,5,6,7. Vertex 5 is connected to 0,1,2,3,4,6. So 0,2,5 have connections among themselves. Let's see if there's a group of five where each is connected to the others. Let's take vertices 1,2,5,6,7. Let's see: 1 is connected to 2,5,6,7. 2 is connected to 1,5,6,7. 5 is connected to 1,2,6. 6 is connected to 1,2,5,7. 7 is connected to 1,2,6. Wait, but 5 and 7 are not connected. So 5 and 7 are not connected, so that's not a K5. Similarly, check another group. Maybe 2,4,5,3,1? 2 is connected to 4,5,1. 4 is connected to 2,5,3,1. 5 is connected to 2,4,3,1. 3 is connected to 4,5, but not connected to 1. So 3 is not connected to 1, so that's not a K5. Another group: 0,2,3,5, maybe 6? 0 is connected to 2,3,5. 2 is connected to all except maybe 3. Wait, 2 is connected to 0, but 3 and 2: looking at edges, (0,2), (0,3), etc. Wait, vertex 2 is connected to 0,1,4,5,6,7. So 2 is not connected to 3. Wait, the edge list does include (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (1,2), (0,2). So no, 2 is not connected to 3. So in that case, maybe K5 isn't present. Similarly, check for K3,3. Let's see. K3,3 is a bipartite graph with each partition having three nodes, each connected to all in the other partition. Maybe if there's a subset of six nodes divided into two groups of three where each in one group connects to all in the other. For example, let's see: vertices 1,2,5 connected to 4,6,7. Let's check. 1 is connected to 2,4,5,6,7. So 1 is connected to 4,6,7. 2 is connected to 4,5,6,7. 5 is connected to 4,6. So if we take the partitions as {1,2,5} and {4,6,7}, then each node in the first partition connects to all in the second? Let's check:

Similarly, vertex 1 is connected to 2, 3,4,6. So vertex 1 is connected to 0? No, the edges for 1 are (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,6). So vertex 1 is not connected to 0,5,7. So the neighbors of vertex 2 (vertices 0,1,3,4,5,6,7) are not all connected to each other. For example, vertex 0 is not connected to 1,4. So maybe we can use the same color for some of them.

Looking at vertices 2,3,5,6,7. Are all the edges present between them? 2 is connected to all of them. 3-5,3-6,3-7. 5-6,5-7. 6-7. So between 3,5,6,7, they form a K4. But vertex 2 is connected to all of them. However, vertex 2 is connected to each, but the other edges between the rest? So the subgraph induced by 2,3,5,6,7 would have edges between 2 and each of the others, and the others have edges forming a K4. So that's a K5? No, because in a K5, every pair is connected. Here, vertex 2 is connected to all, but between 3,5,6,7, they have K4. But 2 isn't connected to 3,5,6,7 via other edges besides the direct ones. Wait, actually, in the subgraph of those five vertices, each pair is connected except maybe between 2 and the others. Wait, no. Wait, 2 is connected to all of them. So in the subgraph 2,3,5,6,7, each of the 5 vertices is connected to every other except 3-5 is connected, 3-6, etc. Wait, actually, in this subset, 2 is connected to 3,5,6,7. Then 3 is connected to 5,6,7. 5 is connected to 6,7. 6 is connected to 7. So does this form a K5? Let's count the edges. For a K5, there should be 10 edges. Let's see: between 2-3,2-5,2-6,2-7 (4 edges). Then 3-5,3-6,3-7 (3 edges). 5-6,5-7 (2 edges). 6-7 (1 edge). Total edges: 4+3+2+1=10 edges. So yes, this is a K5. Therefore, the graph contains a K5 subgraph, which means it's non-planar. Therefore, the four-color theorem doesn't apply here. So it's possible that this graph requires more than four colors. But the question is asking if it can be colored with four colors. If it's not planar, maybe it can still be colored with four colors, but it depends on the structure.

Hmm, looking at vertex 2, it's connected to a lot of other vertices. Let me count its edges. Vertex 2 is connected to 0,1,3,4,5,6,7. Wait, that's seven edges. So vertex 2 has degree 7. That means it's connected to every other vertex except for itself. Wait, the graph has 8 vertices, so vertex 2 is connected to all except vertex 1? Wait no, checking the edges: (1,2) is there, so vertex 2 is connected to 0,1,3,4,5,6,7. So it's connected to all other seven vertices. That's a high degree. Similarly, maybe other vertices also have high degrees. Let me check vertex 3. Vertex 3 is connected to 0,2,5,6,7. So that's five edges. Vertex 5 is connected to 0,2,3,6,7, so also five edges. Vertex 6 is connected to 1,2,3,4,5,7. That's six edges. Vertex 7 is connected to 1,2,3,4,5,6. Also six edges. Vertex 0 is connected to 2,3,4,5. Four edges. Vertex 1 is connected to 2,6,7.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe another approach. Let's check if the graph is bipartite. But a bipartite graph requires 2-coloring, which this isn't. The presence of cycles of odd length might prevent that. But since we have four colors, perhaps there's a way. Alternatively, maybe the graph is 3-colorable. But since the problem allows four colors, maybe it's easier. Wait, the problem allows four colors, so even if it's 3-colorable, using four colors is okay. Wait, but maybe the graph has a higher chromatic number. Let me check the maximum clique size. A clique is a set of vertices all connected to each other. Let's see: for example, vertices 0,5,6: 0 connected to 5 and 6; 5 connected to 6. So that's a triangle (clique of size 3). Similarly, vertices 5,6,4: 5 connected to 6 and 4; 6 connected to 4. Another triangle. Also, vertices 5,6,7: 5 connected to 6 and 7 (if 5 and 7 are connected). Wait, 5 is connected to 6, but 5 is not connected to 7. Wait, looking back: edges include (5,6), (6,7), (5,4), but (5,7) isn't listed. Wait, edges for 5: (0,5), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,6). So 5 is connected to 0,1,2,3,4,6. So no edge between 5 and 7. So the maximum clique size? Let's check for 4-clique. Let's see if any four vertices are all connected. For example, 0,5,6,4: 0 connected to 5,6,4; 5 connected to 6,4; but 4 connected to 6. But does 0 connect to all others? 0 is connected to 5,6,4. But 5 and 4 are connected, 5 and 6, 4 and 6. So that's a clique of size 4? Wait, 0-5-6-4: 0 is connected to 5,6,4; 5 is connected to 6 and 4; 6 is connected to 4. So yes, this is a clique of size 4 because each vertex is connected to the others. Therefore, the clique number is 4. That means the chromatic number is at least 4. Since we have four colors, it's possible. So it should be 4-colorable. Therefore, there must exist a valid 4-coloring.

So, in this subset, there's no K5 because not all pairs are connected. For example, 1 isn't connected to 6, and 3 isn't connected to 6 in the edges listed? Wait, 3 is connected to 6 (edge (3,6) is in the list). Wait, let me check again. The edges for 3 are (0,3), (1,3), (3,6), (3,7). So yes, 3 is connected to 6. Then in the subset 0,1,2,3,6, is every pair connected? Let's see: 0 connected to all. 1 connected to 0,2,3. Is 1 connected to 6? The edges of 1 are (0,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). So no, 1 is not connected to 6. So that subset isn't a K5. How about another subset?

Wait, checking the original edges: (0,7), (1,7), (2,7), (3,5), (3,6). Wait, no, there's no edge between 3 and 7. So in the group 0,1,2,3,7, vertex 3 is not connected to 7. So that's not a K5. How about another group? Let's check 1,2,5,7, maybe. But no, 1 is connected to 2,5,7. But 5 is connected to 1,2,7, but maybe not all. Let me see. Maybe another approach: look for K3,3.

Planar graphs cannot have a subgraph that's a complete graph K5, right? Or if they have minors that are K5 or K3,3. Let me check if there's a K5 here. For example, looking at vertex 0: connected to 1,2,3,5,7. Do any of these form a complete subgraph? Let's check if vertices 0,1,2,3 form a K4. Each pair among them is connected except maybe 1 and 3? Wait, vertex 0 is connected to 1,2,3. Are 1 and 2 connected? Yes. 1 and 3? Yes. 2 and 3? Yes. So 0,1,2,3 form a K4. But K4 is planar. However, maybe there's a K5. Let's check. If we look at vertex 0,1,2,3,5: does 0 connect to all? Yes. 1 connects to 0,2,3,5 (since 1 is connected to 0,2,3, but 1 and 5? Let me check the edges. The edges for 1 are (0,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,7). So 1 is not connected to 5. So that's not a K5. What about another set? Maybe 0,2,5,7: 0 connected to all, 2 connected to 5 and 7, 5 connected to 7. But that's a K4? Let's see: 0-2, 0-5, 0-7, 2-5, 2-7, 5-7. Yes, those edges exist. So 0,2,5,7 form a K4. Similarly, 5 is connected to 0,2,3,4,6,7. But again, not sure if there's a K5. Maybe the graph is planar. Alternatively, maybe it's non-planar, but since four colors are allowed regardless of planarity, maybe it's possible. Wait, no. The four-color theorem applies only to planar graphs. If the graph is non-planar, it might require more colors. But since the question allows four colors, maybe it's possible regardless. Wait, but if the graph is non-planar, it could have a higher chromatic number. For example, K5 requires 5 colors. So if the graph contains a K5, then it's not 4-colorable. But does this graph contain a K5?

This seems like a recurring issue with vertex 4. Maybe the subgraph contains a K4 (complete graph with 4 vertices), which would require 4 colors. Let me check if there is a K4 in the subgraph. For example, vertices 3,4,5,7: 3 connected to 4,5,7; 4 connected to 3,5,7; 5 connected to 3,4,7; 7 connected to 3,4,5. So that's a complete K4 (each connected to each other). Therefore, the subgraph has a K4, which requires 4 colors. But since in the subgraph (excluding vertex 6) we only have three colors available (since vertex 6 is using the fourth), this would make the entire graph require 4 colors for the K4, but vertex 6 already uses one. Wait, but vertex 6 is connected to all these nodes in the K4. So vertex 6 is connected to 3,4,5,7. So if vertex 6 is colored Red, then the K4 (3,4,5,7) each must be colored with Green, Blue, Yellow. But a K4 requires 4 colors, which we don't have, since we're limited to 3 in the subgraph. Therefore, this is impossible. Hence, the original graph is not 4-colorable.

That's connected to every other vertex except maybe itself. Wait, 0,1,2,3,4,5,7. So yes, connected to all except 6 itself. So vertex 6 is connected to all others except itself. So that's a problem because if it's connected to all other 7 vertices, but we have 8 vertices in total, so vertex 6 is adjacent to 7 others.

Similarly, vertex 5 is connected to 0,1,2,3,6. So 5 is connected to 4? Wait, no. Wait, looking at the edges: edges for 5 are (0,5), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (5,6). So 5 is connected to 0,1,2,3,6. So 4 and 5 are not connected. So perhaps there's a K3,3 somewhere?

Now, vertex 4 is Yellow. Then, vertex 5 is connected to 0 (Red),1 (Green),2 (Blue),3 (Red),6 (Green). So 5 can't be Red, Green, or Blue. So 5 must be Yellow as well. But 5 is connected to 4 (Yellow). Wait, but if 5 is Yellow, then 4 and 5 would both be Yellow and they are connected? Wait, 4 and 5: are they connected? Let me check the edges. The edges listed for 4 are (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,6). So 4 and 5 are not connected. Wait, so vertex 4 and 5 are not directly connected. Therefore, vertex 5 can be Yellow even if 4 is Yellow. Wait, but vertex 5 is connected to 0,1,2,3,6. So 5 is connected to 0 (Red),1 (Green),2 (Blue),3 (Red),6 (Green). So 5's available color is Yellow. Assign Yellow to 5.

Another group: nodes 3,4,6, maybe. Node 3 is connected to 4,6. But not sure. Let's see K3,3. A bipartition with each node on one side connected to all on the other. Maybe nodes 3,4,7 versus 0,2,5? Let's check. 3 connected to 0,2,4,5,6,7. Wait, 3 is connected to 0 (in the other partition), 2 (other partition), 4 (same partition?), no. If the partitions are 3,4,7 and 0,2,5, then 3 is connected to 0 (other side) and 2 (other side), 5 (other side). 4 is connected to 0,2,5 (other side). 7 is connected to 0,3,4,5. 0 is in other side, 3 in the other. So 7 would need to be connected to 0 (other), 3 (same), 4 (same), 5 (other). So that might not form K3,3. Alternatively, perhaps another combination. Maybe this is getting too complicated.

So the subgraph induced by vertices 0-6. Let me see if this is 3-colorable. If it is, then 7 can be colored with the fourth color. But 3-coloring isn't necessarily guaranteed. Let's check if this subgraph has any cliques of size 4. If there's a clique of size 4, then it would require 4 colors. Let's see. For example, vertex 1 is connected to 2,3,4,5,6. But does it form a clique? Let's check if any 4 of them form a complete subgraph. For example, 1,2,3,6: 1 is connected to 2,3,6. 2 is connected to 1,3,6. 3 is connected to 1,2,6. 6 is connected to 1,2,3. So that's a complete subgraph (clique) of size 4. Because all pairs are connected. So vertices 1,2,3,6 form a clique of size 4. Therefore, that subgraph requires 4 colors. But wait, the subgraph induced by neighbors of 7 includes these vertices. Therefore, if there's a 4-clique in the neighbors of 7, then each of those four vertices needs a unique color, so vertex 7 would need a fifth color. But we only have four colors. Therefore, this graph is not 4-colorable? Wait, but the original problem allows four colors. But if the subgraph of neighbors of 7 contains a 4-clique, then the total graph would require 5 colors because the 4-clique needs 4 colors and vertex 7 is adjacent to all of them, needing a fifth. Therefore, the graph is not 4-colorable, meaning it's impossible to color it with four colors. But wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Because the entire graph's chromatic number is determined by its own structure. Let me confirm.

How about K3,3? Let's check for bipartite complete. Needs two sets of three vertices each, all edges between them. For example, check if vertices 0,1,2 connect to 3,4,5. But 0 is connected to 3, but 0 isn't connected to 4 or 5. So that might not work. Alternatively, maybe 1,2,5 connected to 3,4,7. Let's see: 1 connected to 3,4; 2 connected to 4,5; 5 connected to 3,4,7. Not a complete bipartition. Maybe another set. This might take a while, but maybe it's planar. Alternatively, maybe the graph is non-planar, but since we have four colors allowed, maybe even non-planar graphs can sometimes be colored with four colors. Wait, the four-color theorem is for planar graphs, but non-planar graphs can have higher chromatic numbers. For example, K5 requires five colors. So if this graph contains a K5 subgraph, then it would need five colors. But I need to check if it does.

Vertex 5 is not connected to 0 directly. Wait, edges: (0,5) isn't in the list. So 0 and 5 are not connected. So 5 can be Red. So 5: Red.

Alternative, maybe change vertex 5's color. Let's see. If vertex 5 is blue instead of yellow, then vertex 6's neighbors: 0 (red),2 (red),3 (green),4 (blue),5 (blue),7 (yellow). Wait, no, vertex 6 is connected to 0,2,3,4,7. Wait, the edges for 6 are (0,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (6,7). So 6 is connected to 0,2,3,4,7.

Looking at the edges, let's see. Vertex 0 is connected to 1,3,4,5,6,7. That's six edges. So vertex 0 has degree 6. Then vertex 1 is connected to 0,3,5,7 – degree 4. Vertex 2 is connected to 4,5,6 – degree 3. Vertex 3 is connected to 0,1,4,6,7 – degree 5. Vertex 4 is connected to 0,2,3,6,7 – degree 5. Vertex 5 is connected to 0,1,2,6,7 – degree 5.

Looking at vertices 0,1,4,5: 0 is connected to 1,4,5; 1 is connected to 0,4,5; 4 is connected to 0,1,5 (through 4-0,4-1,4-5 isn't directly listed. Wait, original edges without 3: 4 is connected to 0,1,2,7. Wait, 4 is connected to 0,1,2,7. So 4 is connected to 0,1,2,7. 5 is connected to 0,1,2,7. So 4 and 5 are both connected to 0,1,2,7, but not to each other. Hmm. Let's see if there's a K4. For example, check if 0,1,4,5 form a K4. 0 connected to 1,4,5. 1 connected to 0,4,5. 4 connected to 0,1 but not to 5. 5 connected to 0,1 but not to 4. So that's not a K4. Similarly, 4 and 5 are not connected. So maybe there's no K4. How about K3,3? Let's see if there's a bipartition of 3+3 vertices with all edges between them. For example, vertices 0,1,7 and 4,5,6. Let's check edges from 0 to 4,5,6: 0 is connected to 4,5,6. 1 is connected to 4,5,7. 7 is connected to 4,5,6. Hmm, maybe not exactly K3,3. Alternatively, maybe 0,1,2 and 4,5,7. 0 connected to 4,5; 1 connected to 4,5,7; 2 connected to 4,5. Not exactly. So perhaps the subgraph is planar. If the original graph is planar, then by four-color theorem, it can be colored with four colors. But since vertex 3 is connected to all others, but in our case, the original graph (with vertex 3 connected to all) may not be planar. Because if you have a vertex connected to seven others, and those seven form a non-planar subgraph, then the whole graph is non-planar. But even if the original graph is non-planar, the question is just if it's 4-colorable. The four-color theorem only applies to planar graphs, but non-planar graphs can have higher chromatic numbers. However, here we are allowed four colors. Let's think differently.

How about 1,4,5,7,3? But 3 is not in the subgraph. Wait, we're looking at the neighbors of 3. Let me check 1,4,5,7, and maybe another. 1 is connected to 4,5,7. 4 is connected to 5,7. 5 is connected to 7. So 1,4,5,7 form a K4? Let's see: 1 connected to 4,5,7; 4 connected to 5,7; 5 connected to 7. So yes, 1,4,5,7 form a complete graph K4. So that's a clique of size 4. So the subgraph of neighbors of 3 has a K4. So if we have a K4, then that requires 4 colors. Therefore, the neighbors of 3 need 4 colors. But vertex 3 is connected to all of them, so vertex 3 needs a fifth color. But we only have four colors. Therefore, this suggests that the graph is not 4-colorable. Wait, but maybe the subgraph isn't a K4. Wait, let's check again: 1,4,5,7.

Wait, planar graphs can't have a subgraph that's a complete graph K5. Let me see if there's a K5 here. Looking at vertex 3, which is connected to 0,1,2,4,5,6,7. Let's see if there's a K5. Let's check vertices 0,1,3,4,5: 0 is connected to 1,3,4,5. 1 is connected to 0,3,4,5. 3 is connected to all. 4 is connected to 0,1,3,5. 5 is connected to 0,1,3,4. So among 0,1,3,4,5, each is connected to the others except maybe between 0 and 2? No, 0 isn't connected to 2. Wait, but 0 is not part of a K5 with 3,1,4,5. Wait, in the group 0,1,3,4,5: 0 is connected to 1,3,4,5. 1 is connected to 0,3,4,5. 3 is connected to all. 4 is connected to 0,1,3,5. 5 is connected to 0,1,3,4. So, actually, 0,1,3,4,5 form a K5 because each pair is connected except maybe 0 and 2, but 2 isn't in this group. Wait, in this group, does every pair have an edge? Let me check:

Looking for a bipartition of two sets of three vertices each, with all edges between the sets. Let's see. Maybe vertices 0,1,3 and 4,5,6?

It's complicated. Maybe the graph is planar. Since I can't immediately spot a K5 or K3,3 subgraph, perhaps it's planar. Thus, by the four-color theorem, it should be possible.

Vertex 5 (Green): connected to 0 (R),3 (B),6 (R),7 (B). Different colors. Even though 3 and 7 are both B, they are not adjacent to 5 at the same time. Wait, 5 is connected to 3 and 7, which are both Blue, but 3 and 7 are not adjacent (check edges: (3,7) isn't listed). So 5 is Green, adjacent to 3 (Blue) and 7 (Blue), but since they are different vertices and not connected, that's okay. The rule is only that adjacent vertices can't have same color, not that all neighbors must have unique colors. So this is acceptable.

Wait, but vertex 4 and 2 are both Yellow. Are they adjacent? Checking edges: (4,2) isn't listed. So no, they are not adjacent. So that's okay. Similarly, vertex 5 and 1 are both Green but not adjacent. Vertex 3 and 7 are both Blue but not adjacent. So this should be a valid four-coloring.

Now, vertex 5. It's connected to 1 (Red), 2 (Red), 3 (Green), 7 (Green). So 5 can't be Red or Green. So possible colors: Blue or Yellow. But vertex 5 is connected to 4 (Blue)? Wait, no. Vertex 5's neighbors are 1,2,3,7. Wait, according to the edge list, vertex 5 is connected to 1,2,3,7. So 5 is connected to 1 (Red), 2 (Red), 3 (Green), 7 (Green). So yes, can't be Red or Green. So possible colors: Blue or Yellow. Let's pick Blue. Wait, but 4 is Blue, but is 5 connected to 4? Looking back at edges: (4,5) does not exist. The edges for 4 are (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,6), (4,7). So no, 5 is not connected to 4. So 5 can be Blue. So 5: Blue.

If we color node 5 Green, then check if that's allowed. Node 5's neighbors: 1 (Red),2 (Red),3 (Yellow),7 (Yellow). So Green is okay. Then node 5: Green. But also, node 5 is connected to 4 (Green). Wait, node 5 is connected to 4? Let me check the edges. The edges for node 5: 1-5,2-5,3-5,5-7. So node 5 is connected to 1,2,3,7. Not connected to 4. So node 5 can be Green, since it's not adjacent to 4. So yes, node 5: Green.

Looking back, vertex 1 is connected to 0,3,4,5,6,7. Let's check if any five of those form a K5. Take 0,3,4,5,6. Let's see: 0 connected to 3? No. The edges for 0 are (0,1), (0,2), (0,6), (0,7). So 0 isn't connected to 3,4,5 except via 1. So there's no edge between 0 and 3, so those five nodes can't form a K5. Similarly, check 3,4,5,6,7: 3 is connected to 4,5,6. 4 is connected to 7,5,6. 5 is connected to 7. 6 is connected to 7. But 3 isn't connected to 7. So 3 and 7 aren't directly connected. So that's not a K5. Similarly, other combinations. So maybe there's no K5 here. Similarly, for K3,3. Let me think: for example, vertices 1,4,7 and 0,2,6. Let's see if each in the first set connects to each in the second. 1 connects to 0, 2, 6, but not necessarily 4 and 7. Wait, no. K3,3 requires that every node in one partition is connected to every node in the other. So let's see: maybe not. So perhaps the graph is planar. Therefore, according to the four-color theorem, it's colorable with four colors. Therefore, possible.

Looking for K5: a complete graph with 5 vertices each connected to each other. Let's see. Vertex 2 is connected to 0,1,3,4,5,7. Let's see if any 5 of these form a K5. For example, vertices 0,1,3,4,5: Are they all connected? 0 is connected to 2,3,5,6,7. 0 is connected to 1? Wait, the edges for 0 are (0,2), (0,3), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7). So 0 is not connected to 1. So maybe not. Let's check another group. Vertex 2 is connected to 0,1,3,4,5,7. Let's check if 2,0,3,5,7 form a K5. 0 is connected to 2,3,5,7 (yes). 3 is connected to 0,2,4,6,7. So 3 is connected to 0,2,5? Wait, 3 and 5: in the edge list, (3,5) is not present. Wait, edges for vertex 3 are (0,3), (2,3), (3,4), (3,6), (3,7). So 3 is not connected to 5. So 2,0,3,5,7: 0 and 3 are connected, 0 and 5 are connected, 0 and 7 are connected. 3 and 7 are connected. 2 is connected to all. But 3 and 5 are not connected, so that's not a K5. Similarly, check another group. Maybe 2,1,3,4,7. 1 is connected to 2,4,7. 2 is connected to all. 3 is connected to 2,4,7. 4 is connected to 2,1,3. 7 is connected to 2,1,3. Let's see: 1 and 3: are they connected? Edge list: vertex 1's edges are (1,2), (1,4), (1,7). So 1 is not connected to 3. So in this group, 1 isn't connected to 3. So not a K5. Similarly, perhaps K3,3? A bipartition of 3 and 3. Let's see. Maybe vertices 0,2,5 connected to 3,6,7. Wait, 0 is connected to 3,5,6,7. 2 is connected to 3,5,7. 5 is connected to 3? No, 5 is connected to 0,2,4,6. So 5 and 3 are not connected. Maybe another combination. Alternatively, perhaps the graph is planar. If it's planar, then four colors suffice. If not, maybe it's still 4-colorable. But the four-color theorem applies to planar graphs. Wait, even non-planar graphs can be 4-colorable. For example, a complete graph K4 is planar and 4-colorable, K5 is non-planar and requires 5 colors. So if the graph contains a K5, it would require 5 colors, but since the maximum degree here is 6, but the four-color theorem isn't directly applicable. However, maybe this graph is 4-colorable.

Alternatively, perhaps the graph is planar. Let's not get stuck here; maybe the four-color theorem applies if it's planar, but maybe it's not.

Its neighbors: 0 (Green) – okay, 3 (Blue) – okay, 4 (Yellow) – okay, 5 (Blue) – okay, 7. Now, vertex 7 is connected to 6 (Red), so 7 can't be Red. Let's check vertex 7's connections. Vertex 7 is connected to 0 (Green), 1 (Green), 2 (Red), 3 (Blue), and 6 (Red). So the existing colors in its neighbors are Green, Red, Blue. So 7 can't be any of those. But we only have four colors: Red, Green, Blue, Yellow. So 7 should be Yellow. Assign Yellow to 7. But wait, vertex 7 is connected to 4 (Yellow). So 4 is Yellow, and 7 is connected to 4.

Vertex 5 connected to 0,1,2,6,7 – degree 5. Vertex 6 connected to 0,1,3,4,5,7 – degree 6. Vertex 7 connected to 0,3,4,5,6 – degree 5. So vertices 0,4,6 have degree 6, 5 and 7 have degree 5, others have degree 4 or 3 (Wait, maybe I miscalculated). Wait, let me check again.

So vertex 0 is connected to 1,2,4,5,6,7. That's a lot—degree 6. So vertex 0 has six neighbors. Then, vertices 1 is connected to 0,4,5,6—degree 4. Vertex 2 is connected to 0,3,4,5—degree 4.

Yes, from edge (1,4), (2,4), (0,4), (3,4), (4,6), (4,7). Wait, does 4 connect to 5? Wait, looking back at the edge list: (2,4) is there, but (4,5) isn't listed. Wait, the edges for 4 include (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,6), (4,7). So vertex 4 is not connected to 5. Therefore, the subgraph 0,1,4,5,6: 0 is connected to all, 1 is connected to 0,4,5,6. 4 is connected to 0,1, but not 5. So 4 isn't connected to 5. So that's not a complete subgraph.

Maybe not. Alternatively, maybe nodes 2,5,6 and 3,4,7. Let me check if every node in the first set connects to every node in the second. 2 connected to 3 (yes), 4 (yes),7 (no). So no.

K3,3 is a bipartite graph with each partition having three nodes, and every node in one partition connected to every node in the other. Let's see if such a structure exists here. Maybe nodes 5 is connected to many nodes. For example, node 5 is connected to 0,1,2,3,6,7. So if we take partitions (0,1,2) and (3,6,7), but node 5 is connected to all of them. Wait, maybe that's a different structure. Alternatively, looking for two sets of three nodes each, with all possible edges between sets. Let's check if, say, nodes 0,1,2 connected to 5,6,7. But node 0 is connected to 5,6 but not 7. Node 1 is connected to 5 and 7 but not 6. Hmm, not exactly. Maybe another combination. It's getting a bit complicated. Maybe the graph is planar, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's non-planar, but the four-color theorem applies only to planar graphs. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify whether the graph is planar or not. So maybe even if it's non-planar, perhaps it can still be colored with four colors. Wait, the four-color theorem only says that planar graphs are 4-colorable. Non-planar graphs can have higher chromatic numbers. For example, K5 requires 5 colors. So if the graph contains a K5 subgraph, then it's not 4-colorable. But as we saw earlier, there's no K5 here. Let me check again.

Node 2 is connected to 0,1,3,5. Node 3 is connected to 1,2,5. Node 5 is connected to all. So between 0,1,2,3,5: does every pair have an edge? 0-1: yes, 0-2: yes, 0-3: no. Wait, 0 isn't connected to 3. So that's missing. So that's not a complete subgraph. Similarly, check another set. Maybe nodes 1,2,3,5,7. Node 1 connected to 2? No. The edges for 1 are to 0,3,4,5,7. So 1 is not connected to 2. So that's not a complete subgraph either. So maybe there's no K5 here. Therefore, maybe the chromatic number is 4. Let's try to color it.

Looking at the edges, maybe check if there's a K5. Let's see. For example, vertices 0,1,2,5, and maybe another. Let's check if 0 is connected to 1,2,5; 1 is connected to 0,2,5; 2 is connected to 0,1,5; but 5 is connected to all three. But K5 would need all five vertices connected to each other. So if we take 0,1,2,5, maybe adding another node. Let's see, 0 is connected to 4,5,6. Maybe 0,1,2,5,7? Let's check if 0 is connected to 7. No, 0 isn't connected to 7. So maybe that's not a K5. How about K3,3? That's a bipartite graph with two sets of three nodes each, all edges between the sets. Let's see. For example, maybe nodes 0,5,6 as one set and 1,2,7 as the other? But checking edges: 0 is connected to 1,2; 5 is connected to 1,2,7; 6 is connected to 1? No, 6 is connected to 0,3,5,7. Hmm, maybe not. Not sure. Maybe the graph is planar. So according to the four-color theorem, it's possible. But wait, the four-color theorem applies to planar graphs. If the graph is non-planar, the theorem doesn't apply. So perhaps I need to check if the graph is planar. Alternatively, maybe the graph is 4-colorable regardless of planarity. But maybe even if it's non-planar, it could still be 4-colorable. So perhaps I should try to find a coloring.

So 1 is not connected to 5. So that's not a K5. How about 4,5,6,7, maybe others? Let's check 4,5,6,7. 4 is connected to 5,6,7. 5 is connected to 6 and 7. 6 is connected to 7. So 4,5,6,7 form a K4?

Wait, looking back at edges: does vertex 3 connect to vertex 2? The edges for vertex 3 are (0,3), (1,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7). So no, vertex 3 is not connected to vertex 2.

Wait, but vertex 4 is connected to 0 (Red), 2 (Blue), 3 (Yellow), 6, and 7. So if we color 4 Green, then we need to check if that's allowed. Since none of 0,2,3,6,7 are Green.

So that's a K5. Because in this case, each node in the subset {0,1,3,5,7} is connected to every other node. So that's a K5 subgraph. Wait, but K5 is non-planar. Thus, if the graph contains a K5 subgraph, it's non-planar. Therefore, the four-color theorem doesn't apply here. But wait, maybe the graph isn't planar, but still can be four-colorable. Because four-color theorem is for planar graphs, but other graphs might also be four-colorable. So even if the graph is non-planar, maybe it's still possible. For example, K5 requires five colors, but if it's a subgraph here, then the entire graph would require at least five colors. Therefore, if the graph has a K5 subgraph, then four colors wouldn't be enough, making it impossible. Hmm, so this is a critical point.

Wait, no, in the given edges, for vertex 3: edges are (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (3,6), (3,7). So 3 is connected to 0,1,2,6,7. So 3 is not connected to 5. So the group 1,3,5,7,0: 3 and 5 are not connected. So that's not a K5. How about 5,7, and others? 5 is connected to 0,1,2,4,6,7.

So no, vertex 2 and 5 are not connected. Therefore, vertex 5 can be Blue. Because vertex 5 is connected to 0 (Green),1 (Green),3 (Red),4 (Red),6. So 6 hasn't been colored yet. Wait, but when we assigned vertex 5 to Blue, we need to check that none of its adjacent vertices are Blue. So 0,1,3,4,6. 0 is Green, 1 is Green, 3 is Red, 4 is Red. 6 hasn't been colored yet, so Blue is okay for 5 as long as 6 isn't Blue. But vertex 6 is connected to 5, so if we color 5 Blue, then 6 can't be Blue.

Looking at the edges, let's check if there's a K5. A K5 would require 5 vertices each connected to each other. Let's see if any 5-clique exists. Let's check vertex 3. It's connected to 0,1,2,5,6,7. Let's see if among these, there's a 5-clique. Let's check 0,1,2,5,6. Vertex 0 is connected to 1? No, 0 is connected to 2,3,5,6 but not to 1. So maybe not. How about 1,2,3,5,6? 1 is connected to 3,5,6. 2 is connected to 3,5,6. 3 is connected to all. 5 is connected to 1,2,3,6. 6 is connected to 1,2,3,5. So in this subset, each vertex is connected to the others except maybe 1 and 2. Let's check: 1 and 2 are not connected directly. So there's no edge between 1 and 2. Similarly, 1 and 5 are connected. So maybe not a complete K5. Maybe a K3,3?

Looking at the edges, let's check if there's a K5. Let's take any five nodes. For example, vertices 2,3,5,6,7. Let's see if each is connected to every other. 2 is connected to 3,5,6,7. 3 is connected to 2,5,6. Wait, 3 is not connected to 7. So, not a K5. How about another set? Let's check 0,1,4,7, maybe? 0 is connected to 1,4,7. 1 is connected to 0,4, but 7 isn't connected to 1. So no. Another group: 2,3,4,5,6. 2 is connected to 3,5,6. 3 is connected to 4,5,6. 4 is connected to 5. 5 is connected to 6. But there are missing edges like 2-4, 3-2 is okay, but 4-2 isn't. So maybe not a K5. How about K3,3? Let's see. K3,3 requires two sets of three nodes each with all edges between the sets. Let me check if such a structure exists. For example, set A: 2,3,5 and set B: 6,7,4. Let's see. 2 is connected to 6,7 (yes), 3 is connected to 6 (yes), 5 is connected to 6,7 (yes), 4 is connected to 5 (yes), but 2 connected to 4? 2 isn't connected to 4. Wait, 2 is connected to 0,3,5,6,7. So 2 is connected to 5 and 6 and 7, but not to 4. So maybe set A: 2,3,5 and set B:6,7,4. Then 2 is connected to 6,7 (but not 4), 3 is connected to 4,6 (yes), 5 is connected to 4,6,7. So maybe there are some edges missing? 2 isn't connected to 4. So maybe that's not a K3,3. Alternatively, maybe another combination. Let's see. Alternatively, set A: 0,1,4 and set B: 2,3,7. 0 is connected to 2 and 7. 1 is connected to 3. 4 is connected to 2 (no, 4 isn't connected to 2). So that won't work. Maybe another approach. Maybe the graph is planar. But I think with so many edges (the number of edges can be calculated to check). Let's count the edges. The given edge list is:

First, let's try to assign colors step by step. Maybe start with vertex 0. Let's color vertex 0 red. Then all its neighbors (1,3,4,5,6,7) can't be red. Now, each of these six vertices needs to be green, blue, or yellow. But they also have edges between themselves. Let's look at vertex 1. It's adjacent to 0 (red), 2,5,6. So vertex 1 can be green, blue, or yellow. Let's pick green for vertex 1. Then vertex 2, which is connected to 1 (green), so it can't be green. Let's look at vertex 2's connections. It's connected to 1 (green), 4,5,6,7. So vertex 2 needs a color different from green. Let's pick blue. Then vertex 3 is connected to 0 (red) and 4,7. Let's assign yellow to vertex 3. Now, vertex 4 is connected to 0 (red), 2 (blue), 3 (yellow), and others. So vertex 4 can't be red, blue, or yellow. The only color left is green. So vertex 4 is green. But vertex 4 is connected to vertex 1 (green). Wait, but vertex 1 is green and vertex 4 is green, but they are connected? Wait, are vertices 1 and 4 adjacent? Let me check the edges. The edge list: Vertex 1 is connected to 0,2,5,6. So 1 and 4 are not connected. So that's okay. So vertex 4 is green. Then vertex 5 is connected to 0 (red), 1 (green), 2 (blue), 4 (green). So vertex 5 can't be red, green, blue. So the remaining color is yellow. Assign yellow to vertex 5. Vertex 6 is connected to 0 (red), 1 (green), 2 (blue), 4 (green), 7. So vertex 6 can't be red, green, blue. So it must be yellow. But vertex 6 is connected to vertex 5 (yellow). Wait, vertex 5 is yellow and 6 is yellow, but there's an edge (5,6)? Let me check. The edges: (1,6), (2,6), (4,6), (0,6), (6,7). Wait, no edge between 5 and 6. Wait, the edges for vertex 5: (0,5), (1,5), (2,5), (4,5). So vertex 5 is connected to 0,1,2,4. No edge between 5 and 6. So vertex 6 can be yellow. Then vertex 7 is connected to 0 (red), 2 (blue), 3 (yellow), 4 (green), 6 (yellow). So vertex 7 can't be red, blue, yellow, green. Wait, that's all four colors.

But in the subgraph 2,3,4,5,6, vertex 4 is connected to 2,3,5. Vertex 5 is connected to 2,3,4,6. Vertex 6 is connected to 2,5. So, in the subgraph 2,3,4,5,6, edges are:

Vertex 6: Needs to be different from 0 (Red) and 1 (Green), so Blue. But vertex 6 is adjacent to 2 (Blue), so that's a conflict. So vertex 6 can't be Blue. Therefore, if 6 is adjacent to 0 (Red) and 1 (Green), then 6 must be Yellow. Wait, but we're limited to three colors here. Wait, no—if the subgraph is to be colored with three colors, then we can't use Yellow. Wait, but the main graph allows four colors. Wait, maybe I got confused here. Wait, the whole graph needs to be colored with four colors, but vertex 7 is taking one color (say Yellow), and then its neighbors (0-6) need to be colored with the remaining three colors (Red, Green, Blue). So yes, the subgraph of neighbors of 7 must be 3-colorable. So in that case, when coloring vertices 0-6, we can only use three colors. So if vertex 6 is connected to 0 (Red) and 1 (Green), then 6 can be Blue. But 6 is also connected to 2 (Blue), which would conflict. Therefore, this coloring doesn't work. Let's try a different approach.

Wait, the edge list has (2,3) and (3,4), etc. Wait, checking the original edges: (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,7). So vertex 3 is connected to 0,1,2,4,5,7. Wait, but vertex 3 is not connected to 6. So 3 and 6 are not directly connected. So maybe there's no 4-clique here.

Vertex 6 is connected to 2 (red), 3 (blue), 4 (blue), 5 (yellow), and also 7 (I need to check vertex 7's connections). Wait, vertex 6 is connected to 2,3,4,5,7. Let's see: 2 is red, 3 is blue, 4 is blue, 5 is yellow. So vertex 6 can't be red, blue, or yellow. Wait, that leaves green. But 6 is connected to vertex 7, which we haven't colored yet. Wait, let's check vertex 7 first. Vertex 7 is connected to 0 (green), 2 (red), 3 (blue), 4 (blue), and 6. So vertex 7 can't be green, red, or blue. So vertex 7 must be yellow. But then vertex 6, which is connected to 7 (yellow), so 6 can't be yellow. So vertex 6's available color is green, as I thought. Let's assign green to vertex 6. But wait, 6 is connected to 5 (yellow), so green is okay. Also, 6 is connected to 4 (blue), so green is okay. But wait, vertex 6 is also connected to 3 (blue) and 2 (red). So green is allowed. So yes, green for 6. Then vertex 7 is connected to 0 (green), 2 (red), 3 (blue), 4 (blue), and 6 (green). So all those colors except yellow. So vertex 7 must be yellow. Let's check: yellow for 7.

Looking at the edges, let's see if there's a K5. Let's check vertex 0: connected to 1,2,4,5,6. If those are all connected to each other, then it would be K5.

Similarly, check for K3,3. Maybe vertices 0,5,6 connected to 1,2,4, but not sure. It's possible the graph is planar. But maybe I don't need to worry about that. Since four-color theorem applies to planar graphs, but even if the graph isn't planar, maybe it's still 4-colorable. So the question is just whether this specific graph can be 4-colored.

Vertex 4 is connected to 0 (Green),1 (Blue),2 (Yellow),3 (Green). Wait, 0,1,2,3. So 0 is Green, 1 is Blue, 2 is Yellow, 3 is Green. Therefore, 4 can't be Green, Blue, or Yellow. But we only have four colors, so the remaining color is Red. But vertex 4 is connected to 6, which is Red. Wait, 4 is connected to 6? Let me check the edges. Yes, (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4). So vertex 4 is connected to 0,1,2,3. But not to 6. Wait, no. Wait, in the original edge list, vertex 4 is connected to 0,1,2,3. So 4 is not connected to 6. Wait, that's a mistake. Wait, the edges for 4: (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4). That's four edges. So in the original edge list, there's no (4,6). So vertex 4 is not connected to 6. Therefore, my earlier thought that 4 is connected to 6 was wrong. So that's a mistake. So vertex 4 is connected to 0,1,2,3. So when I assigned 4 to Red, but 4 is not connected to 6 (which is Red), so that's okay. Because 4's neighbors are 0 (Green),1 (Blue),2 (Yellow),3 (Green). So 4 can be Red. So vertex 4 is Red.

Wait, but 0 is connected to all of 3,4,5. 1 is connected to 0,2,5,6,7. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe another partition. Let's see. If I can find a set of 6 vertices divided into two groups of three where each in one group is connected to all in the other. Let's check vertices 0,1,3 and 2,5,7. Wait, 0 is connected to 2,5,7. 1 is connected to 2,5,7. 3 is connected to 2 (no, 3 is connected to 2 and 5 and 7). Wait 3 is connected to 2 (yes), 5 (yes), 7 (yes). So 0,1,3 connected to 2,5,7.

Because each of the first partition (0,1,3) is connected to each of the second (2,5,7). But wait, does 0 connect to all in the second partition? 0 is connected to 2,5,7. But 0 is also connected to 1,3,4. Wait, but in K3,3, there should be no edges within the partitions. Let me check the partitions. If partition A is 0,1,3 and partition B is 2,5,7. Then edges between A and B: 0-2,0-5,0-7; 1-2,1-5,1-7; 3-2,3-5,3-7. Yes, all those edges exist. But what about edges within partition A? 0-1, 0-3, 1-3. Wait, in partition A, 0 is connected to 1 and 3. Similarly, 1 is connected to 0 and 3. 3 is connected to 0 and 1. So partition A itself is a triangle (K3), which is not allowed in K3,3, which is bipartite. Therefore, this is not a K3,3 subgraph.

Similarly, maybe a subset like 1,2,3,5,7: 1 is connected to all, but 2 is connected to 5 and 7, but 3 is connected to 5 and 7, but does 5 connect to 7? Wait, looking at the edges, there's no (5,7) edge. So 5 and 7 aren't connected. So that's not a complete subgraph. Similarly, checking other combinations. Maybe K3,3? Let's see. To form K3,3, we need two sets of three vertices each, all edges between them. Let me see. For instance, vertices 1,2,3 connected to 5,6,7. But vertex 1 is connected to 5,6,7, but 2 is connected to 5,6,7, 3 is connected to 5,7 (but not 6). So not all required edges are present. So maybe the graph is planar. If it's planar, then four colors should suffice. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe it's not planar, but the four-color theorem applies to planar graphs. If it's non-planar, the theorem doesn't apply, but maybe it's still colorable with four colors. Let's not get stuck on that. Let's try to find a coloring.

Are these five vertices forming a K5? Let's check the connections between 1,2,3,4,7. For example, 1 is connected to 2,3,4,7. But 2 is connected to 1, 3 (wait, no, 2 is connected to 0,1,5,6,7. Wait, 2 is connected to 0,1,5,6,7. So 2 is not connected to 3 or 4. Similarly, 3 is connected to 0,1,4,5,7. So 3 is connected to 0,1,4, and 7, but not to 2. So in the subset {0,1,2,3,4}, 0 is connected to all, but 2 is not connected to 3 or 4. So it's not a K5. How about another subset? Let's see vertex 1, connected to 0,2,3,4,5,6,7. Let's take 1,2,5,6,7. Are they all connected? 1 is connected to all of them. 2 is connected to 1,5,6,7. 5 is connected to 1,2,3,6. 6 is connected to 1,2,4,5. 7 is connected to 0,1,2,3. Wait, so in the subset {1,2,5,6,7}, is there a K5? Let's see:

3 is connected to 1,4 (no, wait, 1 is connected to 3, but 3 is connected to 1,5,6,7. Wait, 3 isn't connected to 4. Wait, looking back at edges: (3,5), (3,6), (3,7); (1,3) is there. So 3 is connected to 1,5,6,7, but not to 4. So in the group 1,3,4,5,7, 3 isn't connected to 4. Similarly, 4 is connected to 1,0,2,6,7. So 4 is connected to 1 and 7 in this group, but not to 3 or 5. So maybe that's not a complete subgraph. Let's check another group. How about 1,5,7,3: which is K4. But K4 is okay with four colors. So maybe the graph doesn't have a K5, so maybe it's four-colorable.

Vertex 6: connected to 0,2,3,4. 0 is Green, 2 is Yellow, 3 is Red, 4 is Green. So 6 can't be Green, Yellow, or Red. So 6 must be Blue. Assign Blue to 6. But wait, vertex 6 is connected to 5 (since in the original edges, (5,7) is an edge but 6 is connected to 5? Wait, no. Let me check the edges again. Vertex 6's edges are (0,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6). So vertex 6 is connected to 0,2,3,4. So vertex 6 isn't connected to 5. Therefore, vertex 6's neighbors are 0 (Green), 2 (Yellow), 3 (Red), 4 (Green). So 6 can't be Green, Yellow, or Red. Therefore, 6 must be Blue. But vertex 6 is not connected to 5, so if 6 is Blue, that's okay. But wait, vertex 5 is Blue. Are 5 and 6 adjacent? According to the edges, (5,7) is an edge, but (5,6) isn't. So 5 and 6 are not connected. So assigning Blue to both is okay.

Now, vertex 6 is connected to 0 (Green),2 (Yellow),4 (Green). So vertex 6 can't be Green or Yellow. So it needs to be Blue. But vertex 6 is connected to 4 (Green) and 5 (Blue). Wait, vertex 6 is connected to 5? In the original edges, vertex 6 is connected to 5 via (3,6) and (3,5), but in the subgraph without 3, 5 is connected to 6? Wait, original edges: (4,6), (2,6). So in the subgraph, vertex 6 is connected to 0,2,4. So vertex 6 is connected to 0 (Green),2 (Yellow), and 4 (Green). So vertex 6's neighbors are Green, Yellow, Green. So possible colors for 6: Blue or Yellow. But since 2 is Yellow, which is connected to 6 (edge (2,6)), so 6 can't be Yellow. Therefore, 6 must be Blue. But vertex 5 is connected to 6? Wait, in the subgraph, 5 is connected to 2,4,7. 6 is connected to 0,2,4. There's no edge between 5 and 6 in the subgraph. So vertex 6 being Blue is okay.

Let's check edges between 3 and 5. The edges for 3: (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (3,4), (3,6), (3,7). So no edge between 3 and 5. So 3 and 5 are not connected. So that's a problem for forming K5.

Alternatively, maybe the graph contains a complete graph of size 5 (K5), which would require 5 colors. Let me check. Let's see if there's a K5 subgraph. For example, looking at vertex 2, which is connected to 1,3,4,5,6,7. Let's see if any five of those form a complete subgraph. Let's check vertices 2,3,6,7,5. Are they all connected? Vertex 2 is connected to 3,6,7,5. Vertex 3 is connected to 2,5 (no, wait, 3 is connected to 5? Let's check the edges. The edges for 3: (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (3,4), (3,6), (3,7). So 3 is connected to 0,1,2,4,6,7. So 3 isn't connected to 5. So 2 is connected to 5, but 3 is not connected to 5. So the set 2,3,5,6,7: 2 is connected to all except maybe 3 and 5? Wait, 3 is connected to 2, but not to 5. So there's no K5 here. Similarly, maybe another set. How about 2,1,3,7,4? 2 is connected to 1,3,7,4. 1 is connected to 2,3,4,7. 3 is connected to 2,1,4,7. 7 is connected to 2,1,3,5,6. But 4 is connected to 1,2,3,6. So in the subset 1,2,3,4,7: each of these is connected except 4 is not connected to 7. So that's not a complete graph. Similarly, maybe another subset. It seems challenging to find a K5 here, so maybe the graph doesn't contain a K5. Similarly, maybe a K4? Let's see. For example, vertices 2,3,6,7. 2 connected to 3,6,7. 3 connected to 2,6,7. 6 connected to 2,3,7. 7 connected to 2,3,6. So that's a K4. So there's a complete subgraph of size 4, which would require 4 colors. So that's okay. But since we have four colors available, maybe it's possible.

Alternatively, maybe there's a higher clique. Let me check. Are there five nodes all interconnected? Let's see. Take nodes 0,1,2,7, maybe another. For example, 0 is connected to 1,2,3,4,5,7. Let's check if 0,1,2,7,3: 0 is connected to all. 1 is connected to 3. 2 is connected to 3. 7 is connected to 3. So 3 is connected to 0,1,2,7. But does 3 connect to all of them? 3 is connected to 0,1,2,4,6,7. So yes, 3 is connected to 0,1,2,7. So in the clique 0,1,2,7,3, does every pair connect? For example, 3 and 1 are connected, 3 and 2 are connected, 3 and 7 are connected, but 3 is connected to 0. However, between nodes 3 and others in the clique: 0-3 is connected. 1-3 is connected. 2-3 is connected. 3-7 is connected. So in the group 0,1,2,3,7, each is connected to each other? Let's check: 0 is connected to all. 1 is connected to 0,2,3,7. But 1 is not connected to 4,5,6. Wait, but within the group 0,1,2,3,7: 0-1, 0-2, 0-3, 0-7. 1-2, 1-3, 1-7. 2-3, 2-7. 3-7. So yes, within this subset of 0,1,2,3,7, every pair except perhaps some? Wait, 0 is connected to all. So 0 is connected to 1,2,3,7. Then 1 is connected to 2,3,7. 2 is connected to 3,7. 3 is connected to 7. So all pairs in this subset are connected. Wait, that's a clique of size 5 (nodes 0,1,2,3,7). Wait, that can't be, because a clique of size 5 would require 5 colors. But the four-color theorem says four colors suffice for planar graphs, but if this graph has a K5, then it's non-planar and might require more colors. Wait, but maybe it's not a K5. Let me check again.

Looking at vertex 0: connected to 1,2,3,4,5,7. Let's check if any of these form a K5. For example, vertices 0,1,2,3,7. Let's see: 0 is connected to all. 1 is connected to 0,2,3,7—so 1 is connected to all except maybe 4,5,6. Wait, in the group 0,1,2,3,7: 0 is connected to all. 1 is connected to 0,2,3,7. 2 is connected to 0,1,4,6,7—so 2 is connected to 0,1,7 but not to 3? Wait, no, checking edges: (2,3) isn't in the edge list. Wait, looking back at the edges: The edges given for 2 are (0,2), (1,2), (2,4), (2,6), (2,7). So 2 is not connected to 3. So in the group 0,1,2,3,7, the connections between them are: 0 connected to all. 1 connected to 0,2,3,7. 2 connected to 0,1,7. 3 connected to 0,1,4,6,7. So 3 is not connected to 2. So that's not a complete subgraph. Similarly, maybe another group. Let's check 0,1,5,7. 0 connected to 1,5,7. 1 connected to 0,5,7. 5 connected to 0,1,4,7. 7 connected to 0,1,2,3,5. So this isn't a complete subgraph either. How about 1,2,3,6,7? 1 is connected to 2,3,6,7. 2 is connected to 1,6,7. 3 is connected to 1,6,7. 6 is connected to 1,2,3. 7 is connected to 1,2,3. So in this group, 6 is connected to 1,2,3. 7 is connected to 1,2,3. But 6 and 7 are not connected. So that's not a complete graph either.

Because 3 is Yellow and 4 is connected to 3? Wait, is 4 connected to 3? Let me check the edges. The edges include (2,3), (2,4), (3,5), (3,6). Wait, no, vertex 4 is connected to 0,1,2,6. Wait, edge (1,4), yes. So vertex 4 is connected to 0,1,2,6. So not connected to 3. Wait, in the original edge list, vertex 4's edges are (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (4,6). So no, vertex 4 is not connected to 3. So if 4 is colored Yellow, that's okay because it's not connected to 3. Wait, but 3 is Yellow, but 4 is not connected to 3, so it's okay. So vertex 4 can be Yellow. Okay.

Now, proceed to color these neighbors. Let's pick vertex 0. Its neighbors are 2 (Red), 3,4,5. So vertex 0 can't be red. Assign it Green. Then, vertex 3 is adjacent to 2 (Red), 0 (Green), 1,4,5,7. So vertex 3 can't be red or green. Let's assign it Blue. Next, vertex 4: adjacent to 2 (Red), 0 (Green), 1,3 (Blue),7. So 4 can't be red, green, or blue. So it has to be Yellow. Then, vertex5: adjacent to 2 (Red), 0 (Green),3 (Blue),6,7. So 5 can't be red, green, or blue. Assign Yellow. But wait, 5 is connected to 4 (Yellow). Wait, 5 and 4: in the edge list, is there an edge between 4 and 5? Looking back: the edges for 4 are (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,7). So no, 4 and 5 are not connected. So 5 can be Yellow even if 4 is Yellow. So that's okay.

6 is connected to 1,2,3,4,5,7. So 6 is connected to all except 0 and maybe others. Wait, 6 is connected to 1,2,3,4,5,7. So 6 is connected to six nodes, but in the subset 1,2,3,6,7: 6 is connected to 1,2,3,7. Similarly, 7 is connected to 1,2,3,4,5,6. So in the subset 1,2,3,6,7: 7 is connected to 1,2,3,6.

The edges for 4: (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,6), (4,7). So 4 isn't connected to 5. So that's another missing edge. So probably there's no K5 subgraph. Similarly, checking other groups.

Let's see if any subset of them form a complete subgraph. For example, vertices 1,4,6,7: 1 is connected to all of them. But are they connected to each other? 4 is connected to 6 and 7. 6 is connected to 7. So 1,4,6,7 form a K4? Wait, a K4 is a complete graph with four vertices. But K5 would require five vertices all connected. Let me check if there's a K5. For example, vertices 1,4,6,7, and maybe another. Let's see, vertex 2: connected to 1,4,6,7.

Let's see: 1 is connected to 0,2,4,5. So 1 is not connected to 3. Similarly, 0 is connected to 1, but 1 isn't connected to 3, so that's not a complete subgraph. How about 2,0,1,3,4? 2 is connected to all of them. 0 is connected to 1,3. 1 is connected to 2,0,4. 3 is connected to 2,0,4. 4 is connected to 2,1,3. But in this group (2,0,1,3,4), each pair: 0 and 4 are not connected. Because edges of 0: does 0 connect to 4? No. 0's neighbors are 1,2,3,5,6,7. So 0 is not connected to 4. Therefore, 0 and 4 are not adjacent. Hence, this isn't a complete subgraph. Similarly, check for K5 elsewhere. Maybe another group: 2,5,6,7,4? 2 is connected to all. 5 is connected to 2,0,1,3,6. 6 is connected to 0,2,4,5,7. 7 is connected to 0,2,4,6. 4 is connected to 1,2,3,6,7. So in this group, 5 and 4: 5 is connected to 4? No. 5's neighbors: 0,1,2,3,6. So 5 is not connected to 4. So this isn't a complete subgraph either. So maybe there's no K5. Similarly, check for K3,3. But perhaps this is getting too complicated. Since the four-color theorem applies to planar graphs, but if the graph is non-planar, maybe it's still 4-colorable. Wait, but non-planar graphs can require up to four colors as well. The four-color theorem says that planar graphs are 4-colorable. Non-planar graphs might require more, but in reality, all graphs are 4-colorable only if they don't contain a complete graph of five nodes. Wait, I think the four-color theorem is about planar graphs. For non-planar graphs, they could require more colors. For example, K5 requires five colors. So if this graph contains a K5, then it would require five colors, but since we have only four, it would be impossible. But since I didn't find a K5, maybe it's 4-colorable. Alternatively, maybe the graph is planar. Let me try to see.

Original edges: (5,6) was present in the original edges as (4,5) and (4,6), but in the remaining graph (without 4), 5 and 6 are connected through edges (0,5), (0,6), but 5 and 6 themselves are not directly connected.

The edges for 2 include (2,7), and for 3: (3,7), and for 4: (4,7). So 6 is connected to 0,2,3,4,7? Wait, the edge list includes (0,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), and (4,7) isn't connected to 6. Wait, wait.

Now, vertex 2 is connected to 1 (Blue), so it can't be Blue. Also, vertex 2 is connected to 3 (Red), and 4 (Yellow). So vertex 2 can't be Red, Blue, or Yellow. Wait, the available colors are Red, Green, Blue, Yellow. But 2 can't be Red (adjacent to 3), Blue (adjacent to 1), or Yellow (adjacent to 4). So the only remaining color is Green. But vertex 2 is connected to 0 (Green). Wait, vertex 2 and 0: Are they connected? Let's check the edges. Vertex 0 is connected to 3,4,5,6,7. Vertex 2 is connected to 1,3,4,5,6,7. So there is no edge between 0 and 2. Therefore, vertex 2 can be Green, even though vertex 0 is Green. Since they're not connected. So vertex 2: Green.

Looking for K5: A complete graph with five vertices where each is connected to every other. Let's see if any five vertices form such a structure. For example, vertex 0 is connected to 1,2,4,6,7. Let's check if any subset of these form a K5. Let's take vertices 0,1,4,5,7. Wait, vertex 0 is connected to 1,4,7 but not to 5. Vertex 1 is connected to 0,4,5,7. Vertex 4 is connected to 0,1,5,7. Vertex 5 is connected to 1,4,7. Vertex 7 is connected to 0,1,4,5. Hmm, but 0 and 5 are not connected. Similarly, 5 and 2 are connected, but 2 isn't in this group. So not a K5. Maybe vertex 4 is connected to 0,1,3,5,6,7. Let me check if any five of these form a K5. Take 0,1,4,5,7. Again, 0 isn't connected to 5. So that's not a complete graph. How about 1,3,4,5,7? Vertex 1 is connected to 3,4,5,7. Vertex 3 is connected to 1,4,5. Vertex 4 is connected to 1,3,5,7. Vertex 5 is connected to 1,3,4,7. Vertex 7 is connected to 1,4,5. Wait, but vertex 3 isn't connected to 7. So, in this group, vertex 3 and 7 aren't connected. So that's not a complete graph. Similarly, other combinations might not form K5. How about K3,3? Let's look for two sets of three vertices each, all connected between the sets. For example, maybe vertices 0,4,7 as one set and 1,2,5 as another. Let's check the connections. 0 is connected to 1,2,4,7. Wait, but in K3,3 each node in the first set must be connected to all nodes in the second set. Let's see. If first set is 0,4,7, and second set is 1,2,5: Check if 0 is connected to all in second set: 0 is connected to 1,2,5? 0 is connected to 1 and 2, but not to 5. So that's not. How about another combination? Maybe 1,4,5 and 0,3,7. Let's check. 1 connected to 0,3,4,5,7. So 1 is connected to all in the other set. 4 connected to 0,1,3,5,7. So 4 is connected to 0,3,7. 5 connected to 0? 5 is connected to 0? Wait, 5 is connected to 0? Wait, looking back at edges: (0,5) isn't listed. The edges for 0 are (0,1), (0,2), (0,4), (0,6), (0,7). So 0 is not connected to 5. Therefore, vertex 5 isn't connected to 0. So in this case, the set 1,4,5 and 0,3,7: 1 is connected to 0,3,7 (yes). 4 is connected to 0,3,7 (yes). 5 is connected to 0? No. So 5 isn't connected to 0. Therefore, that doesn't form a K3,3. Maybe another combination. Alternatively, maybe it's planar. It's possible that the graph is planar, so four colors would suffice. Alternatively, maybe not. But perhaps instead of checking planarity, which could be time-consuming, I can try to assign colors step by step.

This is getting complex. The subgraph induced by the neighbors of 3 (excluding 3 itself) is quite interconnected. Let me think: if I have to color 0,2,4,5,6,7 with three colors, but these vertices have edges between them. For example, 0 is connected to 4; 2 is connected to 4,6,7; 4 is connected to 0,2,5,7; 5 is connected to 4,6,7; 6 is connected to 2,5; 7 is connected to 2,4,5. So this subgraph is a 6-node graph with various connections. Maybe there's a triangle here. Let's see: 2,4,7. 2 connected to 4 and 7; 4 connected to 7. So that's a triangle (2-4-7-2). Similarly, 4,5,7 is a triangle (4-5-7-4). Also, 5,6,2: 5 connected to 6 and 2, but 2 and 6 are connected. So 2-5-6-2 is a triangle. So multiple triangles here.

Planar graphs must satisfy Kuratowski's theorem, which states that a graph is planar if it doesn't contain a subgraph that is a complete graph K5 or K3,3. Hmm. Let me see if there's a K5 here. For example, vertex 6 is connected to all others. So if any five of those form a K5, then the graph is non-planar. Let's check if vertices 0,1,2,6,7 form a K5.

Let's see. If there's a bipartition of six vertices into two sets of three with all edges between them. For example, maybe 0,1,2 and 6,7,5. But 6 is connected to all, so maybe not. This is getting complicated. Maybe it's not planar. But perhaps it's possible to color it with four colors regardless. Wait, four-color theorem applies only to planar graphs. If the graph is non-planar, then it could require more than four colors. But the four-color theorem doesn't limit non-planar graphs.

Wait, 2-5: is there an edge between 2 and 5? Looking at the edge list, 2's edges are (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,6), (0,7), (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,3), (2,6), (2,7). So 2 is connected to 0,1,3,6,7, but not to 5. So 2-5 is not an edge. Therefore, in the group 0,1,2,5,6, edges missing between 2-5 and 5-2. So not a K5.

How about K3,3? Let's see. A bipartition into two sets of three vertices each, with every vertex in one set connected to every vertex in the other. Let me check. For instance, maybe vertex 0 is connected to 1,2,3,4,6,7. If we take vertices 0,1,2 and 3,4,5. Wait, but 0 is connected to 3,4,6,7 but maybe not all. Alternatively, looking for a subset. Let me think. Suppose we take vertices 0,1,2 on one side, and 3,4,5 on the other. But 0 is connected to 3,4; 1 is connected to 4,5; 2 is connected to 3. Not all connections. Not K3,3. Another possibility: 1,2,5 and 0,6,7. Check if each of 1,2,5 connects to 0,6,7. 1 is connected to 0,6; 2 is connected to 0,6,7; 5 is connected to 0? Wait, 5 is connected to 0? Let me check. No, 5 is connected to 1,3,4,6,7. Not to 0. So 5 isn't connected to 0. So that wouldn't work. Hmm. Maybe another combination. Let's see. Maybe vertices 0,6,7 and 1,2,5. 0 is connected to 1,2, but not to 5. 6 is connected to 1,2,5,7. 7 is connected to 1,2,5. But 0 isn't connected to 5. So maybe not. This might not form a K3,3. Maybe the graph is planar? Or maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps it's non-planar but still 4-colorable. Since the problem allows four colors, maybe it's possible.
