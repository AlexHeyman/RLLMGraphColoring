5.  **Conclusion:** To color the vertices in the clique {1, 2, 4, 6, 7}, we would need 5 distinct colors because every vertex in the clique is adjacent to every other vertex in the clique. However, we only have 4 colors available (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow). Therefore, it is impossible to color this graph according to the rules.

7.  **Conclusion:** The graph contains a subgraph (induced by vertices {1, 2, 4, 6, 7}) that requires 5 colors. Specifically, the K4 clique {1, 2, 4, 6} needs 4 distinct colors, and vertex 7 is adjacent to all members of this clique, necessitating a 5th color. Since only 4 colors are allowed, the coloring is impossible.
